Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector.

Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates.

Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month.

German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them.

And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division.

The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"

Ross McEwan said a “bad Brexit” could result in negative growth in Britain and that RBS had become more cautious about lending to some sectors, including retail. “We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year, but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative, and that would affect our profitability and our share price,” McEwan told the BBC. The UK economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. At the height of the financial crisis in 2009, the economy contracted by 4.2%. A decade on from the crisis, UK taxpayers still own 64% of RBS, after the government part-nationalised the bank in 2008 after a collapse in its share price and to help restore confidence in the wider financial system. McEwan said RBS was taking a more careful approach to lending to certain sections of the economy, particularly retail and construction. “There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven’t made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,” he said. The bank’s reluctance to lend to the retail sector reflects the broader malaise across UK high streets, as higher business costs, stretched consumer finances and the rise of online shopping hit retailers with a major focus on physical stores. Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have gone bust this year, while House of Fraser, Debenhams and Carpetright are among a raft of retailers closing stores. McEwan also highlighted the construction industry as an area of concern. “The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital – particularly around London.” He said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year, as firms delayed investment decisions because of Brexit uncertainty. “Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I’ll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it’s really bad I’ll invest elsewhere – that’s the reality of where we are today,” McEwan said. Smaller and medium-sized businesses were continuing to borrow and invest, he said.', 'The Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive has been accused of withholding information from MPs investigating the bank’s mistreatment of small businesses. In a frosty exchange with Nicky Morgan, the Treasury committee chair, Ross McEwan rejected the suggestion that he had misled MPs at an evidence session into heavily criticised practices at the lender’s Global Restructuring Group. Hostilities could yet be resumed at a new evidence session, after Morgan said the committee was considering recalling McEwan to “tell the whole truth”. The dispute arose after McEwan told the committee in January that he was unaware of any suspected criminal activity at the bank, in response to a question by Alister Jack MP. It later emerged that an employee of the bank’s controversial GRG unit was the subject of a criminal investigation by Police Scotland. In a letter last month to Morgan, a Conservative MP, McEwan explained the omission by saying that the case “did not relate” to the subject of the hearing, a four-year investigationby the Financial Conduct Authority into the activity of GRG. McEwan said the bank “would entirely reject the suggestion that the committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave”. But, in a response to McEwan sent this week, Morgan described his explanation as “unconvincing”. “The committee expects clarity and openness from the witnesses that appear before it,” she wrote. “It considers that your response to Mr Jack’s question fell short of that standard, since you withheld information of relevance and interest.” She also criticised the tone of the letter, in particular McEwan’s rejection of the notion that he misled the committee. Morgan said the committee “is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. “Mr McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’ culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” In a statement accompanying the letter, the committee said it might ask McEwan to give further testimony. “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.” In a statement, McEwan said he was “disappointed” by her comments. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,” he said. McEwan and senior figures at RBS are understood to be dismayed by Morgan’s perceived grandstanding in response to what they believe to be a reasonable explanation. The bank is expected to reiterate its defence that the criminal inquiry by Police Scotland had nothing to do with the FCA’s investigation into GRG and fell outside the four-year period covered by it. Earlier this year, the committee published the FCA’s report into GRG in full after the watchdog chose to release only a redacted version. The committee described the details uncovered by the FCA as “disgraceful”, pointing to allegations that GRG caused small firms “material financial distress” while protecting its own profits. Prior to the release of the full report, RBS was accused by Labour MP Clive Lewis of misleading MPs about the extent of GRG’s mistreatment of small businesses.', 'A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown’s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was “corrosive” for banks and taxpayers. “It won’t end well,” he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. “If you want to implement socialism, I don’t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. “There may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.” The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about £955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About £45.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman’s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were “very unlikely” to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. “The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,” he said. He called Labour’s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a “genuinely alarming idea” that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers’ stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of £3bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research’s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: “Labour’s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.”', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner’s “financing investment” report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there’s another proposal – an old one – that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It’s the idea of “using publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country”. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury’s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond’s sell-down but he can’t ignore its existence. So what’s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state’s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today’s share price to get full control would be £11.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises – supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It’s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you’d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it’s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make £55m-£65m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over £50m-ish in April’s update. Now shareholders are told £35m-£40m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher’s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making £139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and “increased competitor discounting,” meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The “non-core” assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth £162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs’ borrowings of £320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn’t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of £520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the £20m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant – less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs’ marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four “The big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,” says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won’t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: “It is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.” The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: “Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.” The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that “by the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed … they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.” The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country’s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland “will be stable until at least 2020”. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: “As we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales – NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches… “We will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.”', 'RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as “total fucking garbage”, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a £45bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) – financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made “false and misleading representations” to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank’s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by “total fucking garbage” loans with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random”. He added that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.” The DoJ said senior RBS executives “showed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it”. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS’ head trader received a call from a friend who said: “[I’m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they’d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.” He responded: “I take exception to the word ‘destroy.’ I am more comfortable with ‘severely damage.’” Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were “raking in the money” and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending “don’t give a shit because they’re not getting paid”, he said. The bank made “hundreds of millions of dollars” from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS’ chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by “every possible … style of scumbag”, adding that it was “like quasi-organised crime”. “Nobody seems to care,” he added. The DoJ criticised RBS’ failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank’s due diligence procedures as “just a bunch of bullshit”, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: “Oh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?” RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank’s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank’s head trader: “Please don’t fuckin’ blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.” Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving “pretty shitty results”. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: “Under the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.” Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: “This settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.” He added that the bank could now “focus our energy on serving our customers better”. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its £45bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth £240m and the Treasury will receive £149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an £801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a £1.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS’s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: “The turnaround of the bank is almost complete.” RBS’s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as “modest” but said payouts to shareholders would increase “materially from here”. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit – only eight months away – was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank’s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS’s latest milestone, saying: “Ross and I are going nowhere.” The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for £2.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “RBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.” RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and “not very anxious” about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: “The dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS – it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a ‘normal’ bank.”', 'The City watchdog is to take no disciplinary action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the mistreatment of small business customers struggling after the banking crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority said it lacked the powers to discipline RBS for misconduct, despite the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of up to 12,000 small businesses by the bank’s global restructuring group (GRG) between 2008 and 2013. An internal memo written in 2009 by GRG advised its staff that “sometimes you have to let customers hang themselves” when in financial difficulty, adding that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. RBS has said the memo did not reflect bank policy or guidance. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision, but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. “The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.” Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: “It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] is regulated. “The government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG.” In February, Morgan’s committee published the City watchdog’s full unredacted report into what the committee called RBS’s disgraceful treatment of small firms that came to the bank for financial assistance after the banking crisis. The group of MPs released the complete report after a protracted standoff with the FCA, which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014, the report said GRG’s activities had resulted in material financial distress for small business customers. Some said they were pushed into bankruptcy. One of them is Nigel Henderson, who ran a hotel business with his wife, Norma, with annual profits of around £500,000 in the late 1990s. He claims GRG, then called specialised lending services, drove the business into bankruptcy and seized all the couple’s personal assets. They now live in a rented house and rely on their state pensions and housing benefit. Pointing to Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, where some bank bosses have been jailed for their role during the financial crisis, Henderson said: “I just don’t believe there was any will by the [UK] authorities to bring the bankers to book … The government have got to get a grip.” The Hendersons cannot claim compensation under the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, a retired high court judge, because it only applies to cases from 2008. Bailey said companies that had experienced loss as a result of how they were treated while in GRG must be appropriately compensated, and that the FCA was closely monitoring the complaints process. The RBS GRG Business Action Group, which represents hundreds of affected small businesses and is pursuing a legal claim on their behalf, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement. The FCA has always been a supine, toothless regulator, more concerned with protecting RBS than ordinary people. It will not stop us in the pursuit of justice through our high court claim.” Bailey said while commercial lending to SMEs was not regulated by the FCA, the watchdog now had the power to hold senior management of banks to account for the way they treat their small business customers, with powers to fine them under rules that came into force in 2016. But the FCA said it could not apply the new powers retrospectively. It also said it found no evidence of dishonesty or lack of integrity, and argued that it could not bring a successful case for lack of competence against senior management. Bailey said: “It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. “Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.” Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said: “The board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. “The board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now.”', 'A thumping £2.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let’s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state’s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown’s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can’t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the “clean” part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks’ share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It’s a third runway at Heathrow, then – well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn’t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline £14bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission’s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to £17.2bn of new borrowing and £7bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about £35bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about £25bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail’s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it’s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission’s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut £2.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there – but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It’s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he’s said he doesn’t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an “orphan”, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely – but not impossible.', 'Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS – much-reduced in size since the bailout – reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale – scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise £3bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour’s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Why did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank’s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.” Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of £1.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price – obviously, that is what everyone would like to do – but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.”', 'Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to. This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago. Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation. Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets. The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis. In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks. Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name; it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off. • Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money', 'Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that – finally – has been put on public display. Here’s a contender from the infamous “Just Hit Budget” memo: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, £5k sounds like you haven’t.” That perfectly captures GRG’s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking – not about the merit of charging £5,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which “widespread” and “systematic” bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings “were not the one-off errors of staff”. Rather, GRG and RBS failed “to put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures”. GRG management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. There was “an intentional and co-ordinated strategy” to focus on GRG’s commercial objectives and to place “inadequate weight” on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn’t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA’s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its “focused” investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there’s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he’s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they’re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander’s board, however, can’t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish – like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell’s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was “error of judgment”, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment – a cool £114,000 plus interest – only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury’s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But £114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the £45.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as “a stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.” It was “the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,” he said. “Our current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.” RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: “RBS’s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the £770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank’s eventual return to the private sector.” RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, £752m for 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group’s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “This represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England’s stress testing exercise.” He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government’s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS’s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS’s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS’s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.” Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow City minister, said: “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.” RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network. “This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is usually described as the City’s watchdog. In the case of the disgraceful treatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group the FCA has proved to be a paper tiger. Let’s be clear. Businesses were badly and systematically let down by GRG, a unit that was specifically created by RBS to help customers cope with the tough business conditions created by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Precious little tender loving care was extended to those in trouble. Instead, as has all too often proved to be the case in the modern City, the interests of the people running GRG were put before those of customers. The FCA, which has been investigating GRG for the past four years knows all that. Unfortunately, after due deliberation, its message to those who mistakenly expected RBS to help during the worst recession since the 1930s was simple: we feel your pain but can do nothing about it. The FCA says it has been stymied because commercial lending is unregulated in the UK, and that it was unlikely to make action against individual members of the RBS senior management team stick either. Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, says the watchdog wants to make sure that businesses that have suffered losses as a result of their treatment by GRG are properly compensated, adding that the complaints procedure is being carefully monitored to make sure that things are put right. That’s welcome, although it smacks of slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, says the whole affair demonstrates the need for a change in the way lending to small and medium-sized companies is regulated. If the FCA lacks the requisite powers, the government should legislate to provide them. Morgan says those affected by the GRG’s behaviour will find the FCA’s lack of power to act “disappointing and bewildering”. She’s absolutely right about that. The lack of action will merely feed the widely held belief that those who caused the crash have escaped punishment while those who were blameless have paid a heavy cost. Paris and Berlin should take slowing of eurozone as a Brexit warning Britain would clearly suffer economic damage in the event that it crashed out of the European Union without a deal next spring. The desperation of the government to avoid that outcome explains why Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been playing hardball ever since talks began last year. The assumption in Brussels is that the UK will have no choice but to accept a Carthaginian peace on the EU’s terms. But there would be collateral damage and, as the latest eurozone figures show, it would come at a time when activity on the other side of the Channel is slowing. The impact of the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is fading, with the result that the eurozone growth rate in the second quarter of 2018 was, at 0.3%, less than half of what it was in the same period of 2017. Not only was that below financial market expectations, it is also likely to prove weaker than the UK’s growth rate during the same period, which looks like coming in at 0.4%. At the margins, this should help Theresa May and her cabinet colleagues as they try to persuade the leaders of the EU27 to pressure Barnier towards softening his approach. The government’s line of argument is twofold: it is time for the EU side to make concessions; and if those concessions are not made there is a growing risk of a hard Brexit that will prove mutually damaging. Barnier will only shift his position if told to do so by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. So far, they have declined to do so. But Berlin and Paris need to be careful. The rise of populism across Europe is directly linked to the poor performance of the economy in the past decade. It would be the hollowest of victories if the price paid for punishing Britain were to be another recession. British Gas rewrites the economic text book British Gas is Britain’s biggest energy supplier but lost 341,000 customers in the first half of the year, a period when prices were raised by 5.5%. The response of owner Centrica to this trend is interesting. In flat contradiction of what the economic textbooks say, it has hinted that further price increases are on the way. The textbooks assume, though, that companies are operating in fully competitive markets and that is not the case with energy.', 'An internal memo in which Royal Bank of Scotland staff were told to let small businesses “hang themselves” has been labelled disgraceful by MPs on the influential Treasury committee, ahead of a parliamentary debate. Labour MP Clive Lewis will call for a public inquiry into banks’ behaviour towards small firms in a debate on Thursday at which allegations that RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG) drove companies to the wall for profit are set to resurface. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. In a section headed “Rope”, the bank’s employees were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Alister Jack, Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway and a Treasury committee member, said: “At a time when banks had created a financial crisis, they should have been standing foursquare behind customers.” “That memo highlights the disgraceful approach the bank took after getting themselves into difficulty, to then transfer problems on to customers whenever they had the opportunity.” Fellow committee member Stewart Hosie MP, of the Scottish National party, said: “The RBS memo makes shocking reading. It was a step by step guide to fleece RBS customers.” In a letter to committee chair Nicky Morgan ahead of a planned appearance before the committee later this month, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan blamed “a junior manager who is no longer employed by the bank”, and said the memo was “not widely distributed”. “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. At Thursday’s debate, Lewis will urge an independent inquiry into how banks treat small business customers and call for a tribunal system to deal with financial disputes involving them. What RBS staff were told “If they sign, they can’t complain.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses.” “Basket cases: time consuming but remunerative.” “Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.', 'It’s been a busy day for economic and corporate news. And a good one for relieved executives at Royal Bank of Scotland, who have been told that the City watchdog does not have the powers to take action against them over the mistreatment of business customers by the bank’s GRG division. The chair of the Treasury Select Committee said it was bewildering the Financial Conduct Authority could not act. Not such a good day for some Dixons Carphone customers. The company has admitted that a data breach means around data from around 10m accounts may have been accessed without authority. On the economic front, eurozone GDP grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter but headline inflation was higher than forecast. The Bank of Japan tweaked its economic stimulus package and said interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time. Results from British Gas owner Centrica and DIY group Travis Perkins were badly received, while overall it was a mixed day for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.95% while Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.19%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 100 points in early trading. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets have made a positive start to the trading day, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and the upbeat consumer spending figures. Shares were also supported by talk that the US and China were looking to re-start discussions about the current trade dispute. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 95 points or 0.36% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.33% and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. US consumers are continuing to spend, especially on restaurants and accommodation. The commerce department said consumer spending rose by 0.4% in June, in line with expectations. The May increase was revised upwards from 0.2% to 0.5%. The personal consumption expenditures price index - excluding food and energy - rose by 0.1%, compared to a 0.2% rise in May. Another call for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its full report on the Royal Bank of Scotland/GRG scandal, this time from the Federation of Small Businesses. Its chairman Mike Cherry said: There’s nothing in the current legislative framework to stop another GRG-type scenario. As long as commercial lending remains unregulated, small firms will be vulnerable. The hope is that – as the FCA claims – the new Senior Managers Regime will lead to a more responsible lending climate in future. Too often, the regulator doesn’t recognise that small business owners have far more in common with consumers than big corporations. Where you have personal guarantees for example – small business owners putting personal assets on the line to secure a loan – then surely that should be deemed consumer, regulated lending. The FCA’s decision follows the announcement that RBS is shutting its redress scheme for GRG customers in the coming months. If you have 16,000 customers who are eligible to use the scheme and only 1,230 have complained, common sense dictates that the scheme needs to stay open for a good while yet, particularly as the bank is still receiving six GRG complaints a week. The FCA needs to publish its full findings as swiftly as possible. The only way to restore trust between small firms and the big banks is to show that the wrongs of the past are being put right, and real change is happening to prevent unfair treatment in the future. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, which includes members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, said the City watchdog should release all its information about the GRG case. In a statement, the group said: At the APPG we are extremely disappointed, but largely unsurprised, by [the FCA] announcement. It is simply not good enough from a regulatory perspective to say that the powers to hold individuals to account simply do not exist. Kevin Hollinrake MP, Co-Chair of the APPG, said: “The FCA should release all findings and evidence they have obtained in their investigation of RBS GRG, unredacted so that the individuals who are responsible for this misconduct are in the public domain. The FCA have an obligation to release this information so that politicians can have a say in whether it is truly the case that no further actions can be applied. As lawmakers we have an obligation to the public to ensure that those who are responsible are accountable and not untouchable, as indeed is the case now where the individuals responsible are protected by the regulatory inadequacy of our current system”. He also stated: “The FCA should release all of their findings so that the untouchable senior managers at RBS GRG, many who remain working in the banking sector, are held to account. The public, the press and indeed the financial sector themselves have a right to know who is responsible for this misconduct”. What has to be made absolutely clear is that this is not the FCA giving RBS an innocent verdict in relation to their GRG unit. It is clear that the FCA do not have the powers to adequately investigate and discipline instances of misconduct to a degree which gives victims any confidence. In the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority saying it does not have sufficient powers to disciple Royal Bank of Scotland executives over the GRG scandal, the head of the Treasury Select Committee has called for a review into whether new legislation is needed. MP Nicky Morgan MP said: It will be disappointing and bewildering for those who got caught up in GRG’s actions that the FCA is not able to act. This demonstrates the need for a change in how lending for SMEs is regulated. The Government should stand ready to introduce any legislation required when it sees the outcome of current reports on redress and should also urgently consider what additional powers the FCA requires to act in cases such as GRG. Here’s Reuters wrapping up the day’s eurozone economic news: The euro zone economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, but headline and core inflation accelerated with unemployment stabilizing at a lower level. The European Union’s statistics office Eurostat estimated that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period and was 2.1 percent higher against the same period of 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent quarterly expansion and a 2.2 percent year-on-year rise. Headline consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent year-on-year in July from 2.0 percent in June, mainly because of a spike in the cost of energy. Core inflation, which excludes energy costs as well as unprocessed food and which the European Central Bank looks at in policy decisions, also rose to 1.3 percent year-on-year from 1.2 percent in June, beating economists expectations. An even narrower core inflation measure that economists pay attention to, which excludes also the costs of alcohol and tobacco, also rose to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in July — again, above expectations. The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Separately, Eurostat said unemployment in the euro zone was at 8.3 percent in June, unchanged from a downwardly revised 8.3 percent in May. Commenting on the eurozone inflation figures, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Eurozone inflation data has pushed pressure back onto Mario Draghi &amp; co, with headline CPI breaching the 2% target for the first time since 2012. While much of the rise in inflation can be attributed to the incredible 9.4% annual rise in the energy component, the fact that we have also seen core inflation jump 0.2% means that many of the underlying components are also being affected. With the ECB set to end their QE programme by the end of the year, markets will be keen to see Draghi’s response should inflation continue to push higher. The weaker than expected eurozone growth figures mean the European Central Bank is unlikely to raise rates before next autumn, says ING Bank senior economist Bert Colijn: The Eurozone economy grew by just 0.3% QoQ in the second quarter with inflation increasing to above 2%. Any “behind the curve” thoughts that may have surfaced earlier this year can be parked. Whereas the decline in growth in Q1 was considered to be due to one-offs, it seems like excuses are running out to explain the even weaker Q2 reading. Perhaps still temporary, but factors with a longer shelf life seem to have brought Eurozone GDP growth down to a lower cruising speed for the moment. The confidence impact of a trade row and weaker real household income growth seem to be spoiling the European party for the moment. Trade uncertainty seems to have already had a significant effect on the Eurozone economy in Q2. While the impact on real export growth has likely been small over the second quarter, the confidence factor has been more important. With lower confidence among businesses and consumers, concerns have likely translated into somewhat weaker domestic demand growth. In an economy in which capacity constraints abound and credit conditions remain favourable, confidence is the likely factor keeping investment down. Lower consumer confidence has taken some of the wind out of the sails from consumption growth. This comes on the back of trade concerns, but also slowing growth in real household income per capita since mid-2017. The second quarter has added to this trend because the rapid pickup in fuel prices has likely outstripped wage growth. French data - the breakdown of GDP is already available in France - confirms that private consumption performed poorly as it declined by 0.1%. Inflation remained high despite the weaker growth path that the Eurozone economy is on in 2018 but mainly driven by higher energy prices. The energy index increased by 9.4% YoY. These effects will weaken over the coming months, bringing the inflation rate more in line with core inflation. The core rate picked up to 1.1%, which is where it was in May as well. This is still weak and very much in line with ECB expectations. As the energy effects are temporary, the high inflation rate should be taken with a grain of salt from a policy perspective at the moment, so will the ECB. The implications of the lower cruising speed of the Eurozone economy are quite clear. The weaker cyclical picture and low core inflation provide little reason for the ECB to increase rates before autumn next year. Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed (unsurprisingly) the FCA statement. Chairman Howard Davies said: The Board welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that it has concluded its investigation into the bank and that no further action will be taken. We await the publication of the FCA’s full account and will reflect carefully on its findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy. The Board continues to focus on putting things right for customers through our complaints process and ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated. The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty is fundamentally different now. As a reminder, here is our story from February which includes details of how RBS mistreated its business customers: Elsewhere, the Financial Conduct Authority has said it can take no action to discipline Royal Bank of Scotland management over the mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its Global Restructuring Group subsidiary. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive said: Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success. We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable. I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion. The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers. We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right. Meanwhile eurozone inflation has come in higher than forecast. The headline figure rose by 2.1% year on year in July compared to 2% the month before and expectations of an unchanged number. Eurozone GDP grew by 2.1% year on year in the second quarter, down from 2.5% and lower than the forecast 2.2%. On a quarter by quarter basis it grew by 0.3%, compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise. Two more big fallers after updates, this time in the mid-cap FTSE 250. Building materials group Travis Perkins is down nearly 10% after it warned 2018 operating profits would be at the lower end of expectations. The company, which owns the Wickes chain, blamed weak demand in the home DIY market. Meanwhile Games Workshop, whose shares have been strong performers recently, is down more than 6% despite reporting a near doubling of full year profits to £74.5m. Germany’s jobless total fell by 6,000 in July to 2.338m, compared to expectations of a 10,000 decline. The unemployment rate was steady at 5.2%, as forecast. Here’s our story on the Dixons Carphone data breach: Dixons Carphone said an investigation into a massive data breach has found personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed last year, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought. The electronics retailer had estimated the attack involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records, when it first reported the breach in June. It said there was no evidence of any fraud. Alex Baldock, chief executive, said: “Since our data security review uncovered last year’s breach, we’ve been working around the clock to put it right. That’s included closing off the unauthorised access, adding new security measures and launching an immediate investigation, which has allowed us to build a fuller understanding of the incident that we’re updating on today. “Again, we’re disappointed in having fallen short here, and very sorry for any distress we’ve caused our customers. I want to assure them that we remain fully committed to making their personal data safe with us.” The company said records containing personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses had been accessed, but not financial information. It is writing to customers to apologise for the data breach, but does not plan to pay compensation as there is no evidence that anyone has suffered any financial loss. “While there is no evidence that some of this data may have left our systems, these records do not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence that any fraud has resulted,” Dixons said. The full report is here: Some big falls on the FTSE 100 from company’s reporting results. Rentokil Initial is down 4.4% after half year profits dropped 81.5% although last year’s figure included a one off £462m profit on the disposal of its workwear business. Revenues fell 4.7%. Standard Chartered is 3.4% lower despite a 34% rise in profits, as worries about a trade war unsettle investors. And British Gas owner Centrica is down 3.5% as it reported a 20% fall in profits at its consumer division and announced the loss of another 226,000 customers or 1% in the first half. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: Centrica results make for some grim reading again but management does sound a little more confident than the talk of ‘material uncertainty’ we got at the start of the year... The UK Consumer division is leaking cash and customers. Although the customer churn has slowed with accounts down just 1%, profits there fell 20%. The cold snap could have been good for Centrica but higher wholesale costs, fewer customer accounts and the prepayment cap all weighed on profits. And while it’s slowing, the loss of customers needs to be arrested fast – cutting costs is working for now but is not sustainable longer term. Centrica lost 226,000 customers in the first half and the fact that this is flagged as a better performance than previously shows just how bad the situation is. It’s a cautious opening for European markets, with a raft of company results, some key economic data ahead and continuing concerns about valuations in the technology sector after major falls for Facebook and Twitter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.07%, while Germany’s Dax edged 0.1% higher but France’s Cac fell 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.04%. The Bank of Japan’s actions today continue its dovish tendencies. Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank said: When it comes to the July BoJ meeting, there was more than meets the eye – with the central bank making subtle, yet curious, tweaks to its unconventional policy artillery. But if anyone was in doubt, the super-easy BoJ policy is still very much in place; while officials will allow for greater flexibility in long-term yields, it’s important to stress the two-way flexibility here (not just upwards, but also downwards). In fact, by firmly restating the annual ¥80trn JGB purchase target, the BoJ are showing no real appetite for a rapid rise in long-term yields (there was explicit aversion to this in the statement). What sealed the dovish deal was the guidance that the BoJ will ‘maintain very low rate levels for an extended period of time’ – which is not too dissimilar to what the ECB stated last month. Back in the UK, and Dixons Carphone had previously announced it had found unauthorised access to some of its data. Now it says that around 10m records containing personal data may have been affected in 2017. It says there is evidence some of this data may have left its systems but it maintains these records did not contain payment card or bank account details and there is no evidence of any fraud being committed. It is now contacting all of its customers to apologise and advise them of the steps they need to take to minimise the risk of fraud. German consumers are spending freely according to the latest retail sales figures. They rose 3% year on year in June, up from a 1.2% rise in May and much better than the 1.5% increase expected by analysts. The month on month figure showed a 1.2% increase, compared to a 1.5% decline in May. Here are the opening calls for the European markets from IG: In Asia the Hang Seng is down 0.53% while the Nikkei 225 is up 0.039%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors will be anticipating another nervy day on the markets after a weak start to the week. The technology drop which followed last week’s poor results from Facebook and Twitter continued on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its third decline of more than 1% in a row. Will Apple, which reports later, be able to turn the tide? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Apple shares managed to outperform [on Monday], only declining 0.5%, but only because investors are looking ahead to tonight’s Q3 earnings announcement, but even here there may be cause for concern. Lower average selling prices at its Q2 update suggested that buyers were opting for cheaper models, perhaps indicating that iPhone X sales may have peaked. Whether this is true or not is likely to be difficult to determine given that Q3 tends to be a weak quarter in any case, as it tends to be a precursor to a range of new product launches or updates, which tend to happen in Q4. Of more importance will be its burgeoning services business, which includes music, games, apps and Apple pay fees, and which has slowly grown in importance, and has seen revenues rise consistently since 2012. It is a busy day for company results ahead of the start of the summer lull, with BP already reporting its first dividend hike since 2014. On the economic front we have eurozone GDP figures, with the second quarter expected to show a dip from 2.5% to 2.2% on an annualised basis. Initial July inflation figures for the bloc are forecast to remain at 2% on a headline basis, with the core number edging back to 1%. Hewson said: Last week the European Central Bank signed off for its summer break by playing down expectations that we’d see a rate rise much before the end of Q3 next year, and this candour from President Mario Draghi went some way to help push the euro down towards the bottom end of its recent range. Since then we’ve seen it start to edge back up again despite a strong US Q2 GDP number, which has seen US rates edge back up again, and today’s latest preliminary flash EU CPI number for July could well prompt a further recovery towards the 1.1800 area. Inflation pressures have popped higher in recent months, helped by rising energy prices, however these do appear to have stalled a little, particularly given that core prices dropped below 1% in June to 0.9%. Earlier the Bank of Japan said it would be more flexible in its asset purchase programme, and vowed to keep interest rates low for the time being. Also today, the Financial Conduct Authority is due to publish its latest report on its investigation into Royal Bank of Scotland’s mistreatment of small and medium sized businesses through its global restructuring group. Agenda: 10.00 BST Eurozone inflation and GDP 10.00 BST FCA report into Royal Bank of Scotland 13.30 BST US personal spending figures', 'Three-quarters of the staff and nearly all the senior managers at Royal Bank of Scotland’s new division, which supports struggling businesses, previously worked at its controversial Global Restructuring Group, which has been accused of pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Treasury select committee, which last week published a full report into the GRG scandal, said 136 of 182 employees at the current restructuring business and 30 out of 32 senior managers came from GRG. At a select committee hearing in January, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he believed only two senior managers had come from GRG, including the head of restructuring, Laura Barlow. RBS now says this comment referred to only the most senior management grade. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said: “Mr McEwan has assured the committee that the culture at RBS Restructuring is fundamentally different from that of GRG. “The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise. “I have asked Mr McEwan to set out how the training programme and performance objectives of these staff have been developed to address the toxic culture described in [last week’s] report.” The bank has so far paid £1m in claims to GRG’s victims, and expects that to rise to £5m, according to a letter from McEwan to the committee. Morgan said the payments so far were surprisingly low. She added: “There remains a substantial sum of money – up to £280m – within RBS’s earmarked budget for its complaints process, which could be paid out under consequential losses. “Mr McEwan has acknowledged that consequential loss is often far greater than direct loss. To provide confidence that fair and reasonable compensation is being provided, decisions on consequential loss must be subject to independent oversight. RBS shouldn’t be marking its own homework.” Last week’s report, commissioned by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. The Treasury committee labelled RBS GRG’s behaviour as “disgraceful”.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its first annual profit in a decade, but admitted it is braced for a multibillion-pound hit from US regulators. The bank, which is still 71%-owned by the government, made a profit of £752m in 2017, following a £7bn loss in 2016. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, declared it a symbolic moment and an indication RBS had moved on. The bank, however, would still have been in the red if a long-anticipated fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had arrived during the financial year. “RBS was the largest bank in the world 10 years ago, with a balance sheet of £2.2tn, and it spectacularly fell from grace,” McEwan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We’ve been restructuring the bank, but it’s taken time and a lot of cost to come out of countries and businesses we didn’t want to be in.” McEwan flagged an ongoing investigation by the DoJ in the US over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages, which is likely to dent any future profits. “We have been heavily hit with the sins of the past, and still have one large litigation and contract issue with the US Department of Justice,” McEwan said. The bank has yet to resume dividend payouts to shareholders and is expected to do so only once it has reached a settlement with the DoJ. Shares in RBS closed down nearly 5% on Friday, as the potential fine weighed on investors’ minds. The bank’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said it was “not the moment to declare a final victory. We still have costly legacy issues to resolve.” He added that uncertainty over Brexit was a challenge to the bank’s European business. McEwan told reporters the repair job would only be fully complete when it had a “normally functioning bank that our customers our proud to operate with, our staff are proud to be part of, and shareholders who actually want us. It’s clear the government - quite rightly - doesn’t want to be the long-term shareholder.” He said the swing back to profit was one of the signals the bank was returning to normality, but added a resolution with the DoJ and resumption of a dividend payment were also part of the story. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS’s return to profit in 2017 amounted to “a stay of execution rather than a pardon” because of the looming US fine. “It’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis,” he said. “Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US, which is going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point.” RBS became the latest bank to reveal it pays men a lot more than women, with female employees earning on average 37.2% less than their male colleagues. “The gender pay gap is not where we want it to be,” McEwan said. “What it shows is that we need to have more females in senior roles.” RBS is hoping to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, including the revelation that it deliberately mistreated thousands of struggling small business customers who came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. Earlier this week an influential group of MPs said the bank’s treatment of small firms via its GRG division was disgraceful. The Treasury committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, published a full unredacted report into the scandal after the City regulator published only a redacted version. “Our progress over the last few years has given us a stronger platform to compete in a rapidly changing market,” McEwan said. “And with many of our legacy issues behind us, the investment case for this bank is much clearer and the prospect of returning any excess capital to shareholders is getting closer.”', 'The Treasury committee has published the full unredacted report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to it for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The influential group of MPs, chaired by Nicky Morgan, released the complete report after a protracted stand-off with City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which had published only a redacted version. Commissioned by the FCA in 2014 after allegations by former RBS clients, the 350-page document details “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group, resulting in “material financial distress”. Speaking as she announced the terms of an inquiry into the financing of small businesses, Nicky Morgan said: “The findings in the report are disgraceful.” “The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the GRG scandal had made firms wary of applying for bank loans and called on the Treasury committee to reassure them “that another GRG can’t happen again.” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This report shines a light on the gruesome culture within GRG in its dealing with RBS business customers. It paints a very sorry picture of the excesses of the banking industry during the financial crisis and in its aftermath.” The FCA, which is still investigating GRG, usually deems such reports confidential but the Treasury committee invoked parliamentary privilege to publish it, citing the public interest. Written by compliance and risk management group Promontory and accountancy firm Mazars, the report covers six years in which 5,900 struggling businesses were referred to RBS’ specialist turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group. The authors sifted through 323 gigabytes of data, including 1.5m pages of documents and 270,000 emails. They concluded that the behaviour of GRG staff was “endemic” and that managers ought to have been aware of the damage that was being done to small businesses. What RBS did “Just Hit Budget” memo A memo entitled “Just Hit Budget” was circulated among GRG staff as a training aide. It contained advice on “how to get a customer to agree chunky fees and upsides and thank you for it”. In a section headed “Rope” the memo said: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what’s coming when they fail to deliver.” “Missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses,” staff were told. Regarding businesses in severe distress, the memo said: “Basket cases: Time consuming but remunerative.” On fees to be charged, staff were told: “Be specific: avoid round number fees – £5,300 sounds as if you have thought about it. £5k sounds like you haven’t.” The FCA report concluded that the memo was “indicative of an unprofessional culture that set little store by the interests of the customers handled by GRG. Rather customers were viewed as opportunities.” “Don’t take the p*ss” When a shop went under, GRG staff were invited to cherry-pick items for themselves. They were told: “Can you go in and add your name and what you want ... It’s looking tight [...] to get any special treatment here so keep things to staff only and don’t take the p*ss. Bullying and intimidation Small business owners complained of intimidation. One said: “At one point (the GRG manager was) banging on the table with his hand really loudly, shouting at the top of his voice, issuing threats of receivership.” Another customer complained of “cynical and bullying tactics … which are frankly way out of order”. They were also threatened with being put into bankruptcy. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Mocking customers A December 2010 email included “mimicry” of a customer’s foreign accent that the FCA deemed “disrepectful of the customers’ nationality”. The report’s verdict “There was in certain respects widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers by RBS,” the report found. It described this treatment as both “systematic” and “endemic”, adding that GRG’s behaviour had “profound impacts” in some cases. The report’s authors found that 16% of business they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. “This was not in our judgment a result of idiosyncratic decisions by local managers, but was endemic in GRG’s arrangements in respect of those dealing with SMEs,” the report said. The incentive to boost revenues meant that staff “would take action that was unfair and inconsistent with genuine efforts to turn a distressed SME around,” the report found. It warned this might place an “otherwise viable business on a journey towards administration, receivership and liquidation”. “There was in practice little focus on returning customers to financial health [...] through genuine business restructuring.” Customers felt “poorly treated, bullied, threatened, often exploited” and were met with a “dismissive attitude” when they complained. GRG’s management “was aware (or should have been aware) of these issues”. “It is clear that the bank was aware, at least in part, of some of these failures but, it would appear, chose not to prioritise action to overcome them.” How RBS responded RBS said it is “deeply sorry” that customers were not treated well by staff in GRG during and after the the 2008 financial crisis. “The report makes for very difficult reading and some of the language used by our staff in the past was clearly unacceptable,” it said, though the most serious allegation – that staff “deliberately targeted otherwise viable businesses in order to distress and asset-strip them for the bank’s profit – has been shown to be without foundation”. The banks said it has responded by: Putting in place a complaints process overseen by retired high court judge Sir William Blackburne Setting up an automatic refund of fees charged by GRG. The bank said: “The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally since the period under review and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress.”', 'A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank’s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee’s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of “endemic” behaviour by staff in RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division’s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from £400,000 to £2m, by using the “Kissinger school of negotiation”. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to “pick a number, any number”, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. An internal memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were advised that “missed opportunities will mean missed bonuses”. The FCA’s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it “appears likely to have caused material financial distress”. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms “hang themselves”, which was entitled: “Rope.” “For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,” he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer “material financial distress” due to GRG’s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: “A leaked version of the report does not change the FCA’s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland misled parliament over the extent of its mistreatment of struggling business customers, the shadow Treasury minister has claimed. Labour’s Clive Lewis told the Commons on Tuesday he has seen an un-redacted copy of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) investigation into practices at the bank’s restructuring unit, which states the lender’s behaviour was “systemic and widespread”. The shadow Treasury minister added that the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and its chairman, Sir Howard Davies, “misled the Treasury select committee in their evidence and [the bank] had a stated policy of misleading members of this house”. The MP has now handed the document over to the chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. Lewis’s comments follow McEwan’s and Davies’ grilling last week at the hands of the Treasury committee, which is investigating allegations that the bank’s Global Restructuring Group [GRG] unit intentionally pushed some struggling businesses towards failure to pick up their assets on the cheap. During that hearing the RBS chairman admitted the report contained instances “of which nightmares are made”. However, the two directors argued that the worst examples of behaviour within GRG were not “widespread”. Lewis told MPs: “Far from being isolated incidents of poor governance as they claimed to the committee, this report explicitly states their behaviour was ‘systemic and widespread’. In one shocking passage ... the bank boasted one family business was set to ‘lose their shirts’ so RBS could get a ‘chunky equity deal’. “Furthermore, it is clear the summary of the report the FCA has published is, what I would politely describe as, a sanitised version.” The FCA has agreed to publish the full GRG report after RBS said it would not prevent its release. Morgan said: “The FCA has consented to publish [the] report once it has completed its [enforcement] investigations into conduct at GRG. The committee expects these investigations to be completed swiftly.” RBS said: “The evidence we provided to the Treasury committee accurately reflected the bank’s position. We are not clear on what basis the allegations are being made, but we would strongly deny the suggestion that we misled the committee.”', 'Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, has reached a $765m (£591m) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: “We are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.” However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: “If there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven’t seen any impact in our business so far.” He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether “the rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen”. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: “The potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. “But in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.”', 'The latest RBS stake sale by the UK government could hit the bank’s share price in the short term, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The RBS share price has bounced back from its slump after the EU referendum, but the taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability, but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge. We will learn more when details of the share price attained in the sale are released. In August 2015 the government sold 5.4% of the bank at £3.30 per share, which the National Audit Office estimated crystallised a loss of £1.1 billion, or £1.9 billion if you include the cost of financing. RBS has cleared several obstacles which have now unblocked the road to re-privatisation, in particular settling claims for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US. Today’s share sale is good news for private investors in RBS because it is a step towards becoming a normal bank again, though government sales may put downward pressure on the share price in the near term. As a business RBS remains a work in progress, and consequently an investment for recovery investors with a long term investment horizon. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. As if to emphasise the market uncertainty facing the RBS share sale - which should be priced overnight after gauging demand from institutions- European markets have lost their early gains. However they still ended, for the most part, in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 39.52 points or 0.51% at 7741.29 Germany’s Dax added 0.37% to 12,770.75 France’s Cac climbed 0.14% to 5472.91 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 22,009.95 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.22% at 9750.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.76%. Here’s our story on the RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when George Osborne sold a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. The report is here: The share sale is due to take place this evening with an offering to institutional investors. Here is the full announcement from UK Government Investments, the body which manages the country’s RBS stake: UKGI announces that it intends to sell part of HM Treasury’s shareholding in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. The disposal of the Company’s ordinary shares will be by way of a placing to institutional investors. The price at which the Shares are sold will be determined by way of an accelerated bookbuilding process. The book will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The Placing is expected to comprise of approximately 925 million Shares, representing approximately 7.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. As a result of the Placing, the overall size of HM Treasury’s shareholding in the Company will be reduced from approximately 70.1% to approximately 62.4%. UKGI and HM Treasury have undertaken to the Bookrunners named below not to sell further shares in the Company for a period of 90 calendar days following the completion of the Placing without the prior written consent of a majority (by participation) of the Bookrunners. Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities under the marketing name J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc have been appointed to act as joint bookrunners in connection with the Placing. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited is acting as Capital Markets Adviser. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal counsel to UKGI in respect of English and US law. Details of the Placing Price and the number of Shares sold will be announced in due course. Settlement and delivery of the Shares is expected to take place on 7 June 2018. At last week’s annual meeting, the bank’s finance director did not seem keen on the government selling shares at the moment. UK Government Investments has announced it will place 925m shares in RBS with institutional investors, representing about 7.7% of the bank. The move cuts its stake from the current 71%. Following last week’s annual meeting of Royal Bank of Scotland , the government has announced it plans to sell £2.6bn worth of shares in the taxpayer-owned bank. Wall Street is holding onto its gains but the picture is slightly different in Europe. Most markets have come off their best levels as we head to the close, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is in negative territory, down 0.33%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Stocks have held on to some of their gains today, but the day has not gone entirely the bulls’ way. While Italian concerns have receded from view, trade wars remain the big concern. Given the performance of US equities, which have outpaced their European brethren today, it looks like the market is, for now at least, more concerned that European stocks will be harder hit than their US counterparts. Overall however, risk appetite appears pretty solid for the day, especially when the lack of macro data is factored into the equation. Particularly encouraging has been the continued strength in tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 only 1% away from its previous record high. Despite the renewed trade tensions, markets are making a good start to the week. But this optimism is unlikely to last, says Ingvild Borgen Gjerde at Capital Economics: Global equities extended their recent rebound on Monday, which has occurred despite renewed tensions between the US and the rest of the world over international trade. We can think of three key reasons why this has happened. None of them, however, is especially reassuring. The first reason is that investors have acclimatised to Donald Trump’s “megaphone” diplomacy. Despite the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, investors presumably see it as a negotiating tactic, rather than the start of a full-blown trade war that could have serious ramifications for economic growth. Although we share this view, the risk of a trade war is greater now than it has been for many years. So at the very least, the risk ought to continue to curb investors’ enthusiasm for equities. The second reason is that the political situation in Italy has calmed down, as evidenced by the sharp fall in the 10-year government bond yield there since last Tuesday. But while the government sworn in by the president on Friday was arguably more market friendly than many might have feared, we don’t think that Italy’s problems are over and expect yields there to rise once more in due course. If we are right, global equities will probably come under pressure again. The third reason is that US economic data released on Friday were upbeat, with both the employment report and ISM manufacturing index for May coming in stronger than expected. Although growth in the US economy is likely to remain healthy this year, we think that it will falter in 2019 as monetary tightening bites and fiscal stimulus fades. Growth is also likely to slow elsewhere, if not as rapidly. This is significant because the rally in global equities since mid-2016 has been mainly driven by an upturn in the global economy. The upshot is that we doubt that the recent rebound in global equities will continue. On the contrary, we think that their peak has already passed, and that they will move gradually lower during the rest of the year and in 2019. US factory goods orders fell by more than expected in April, dragged down by weak demand for aircraft and machinery. Orders dropped by 0.8%, worse than the forecast decline of 0.5%. This is the worst April since 2012. The March figure was revised up from a 1.6% increase to 1.7%. The decline could be temporary, however, given some positive manufacturing surveys in May. Wall Street has followed the global trend, shrugging off trade war fears and moving higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or 0.76%, as investors continue to celebrate Friday’s better than expected jobs numbers. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.45% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.37% higher. One of the companies moving higher is Apple, heading closer to a $1trn valuation: Over in Argentina, the International Monetary Fund has said talks about it giving financial support to the country were well advanced: Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s Director of the Western Hemisphere department, said: IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have been engaged in a very constructive and close dialogue in response to the authorities’ request for financial support for their economic plan. Talks are well advanced. As we have said all along, this will be a plan driven by the Argentine government’s priorities, with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable, and strengthening the local economy in light of the recent financial market turbulence. Donald Trump has defended his new tariffs, arguing that he is actually fixing the playing field on global trade. The president has been rather active on Twitter this morning. Remarkably, he claimed he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself (but won’t, as he’s done nothing wrong....). Investors should stay alert; Trump may be heading towards a titanic clash with special counsel Robert Mueller.... Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is signalling (finally) that it will not be signing up to Greece’s third bailout programme, which is due to expire this summer. With less than three months before the debt-stricken county exits its current programme, the Fund says the likelihood of it contributing to the rescue package financially is fading fast. The Washington-based body had promised to boost the programme – Greece’s third since May 2010 - with a €1.6bn credit line if euro area creditors agreed to far-reaching debt relief for Athens. Talks on the issue, conducted on the sidelines of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Canada, failed to make progress with both the EU and IMF agreeing to return to negotiations later this week in Paris. Speaking to Greece’s state-run news agency late on Sunday, the Fund’s Greek representative Michalis Psalidopoulos said since the organisation “probably does not have enough time to activate its program” it would continue to contribute only in its capacity as technical advisor. But Mario Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers said the EU is still determined to reach a debt relief deal for Greece by the June 21 euro group – giving it enough time to keep to its planned bailout exit on August 20. IMF participation is crucial if the deal is to be credible to markets, he told Reuters at the weekend. Talks in Paris on Thursday are likely to explore several options including prolonging maturities on loans from Greece’s second bailout program. Separately, Greece has taken another step towards normality by relaxing some of the capital controls introduced three years ago: Good news: The sale of Aunt Bessie’s to Nomad Foods shouldn’t lead to job cuts at its production operation in Hull. Wayne Hudson, MD of Birds Eye UK, has suggested the 400 jobs at the site should be safe. He told the Hull Daily Mail that: We have no plans whatsoever to close the factory in Hull. We will be working with the team there to understand how we can continue the great job they have done. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe and Asia’s lead when it opens in two hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to gain 140 points, or over 0.5%. Wall Street is still taking comfort from last Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, which suggests the US economy is in good shape. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA explains: The jobs report on Friday was yet another reminder of how well the US economy is doing and why the Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy despite constantly being questioned about the need to do so when inflation is only accelerating at a moderate pace. Strong job gains combined with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8% and a slight uptick in wage growth was welcome at a time when people are generally fretting about the threat posed by an unnecessary trade war. It’s a little surprising that investors aren’t more concerned about the hoofing delivered to Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at last weekend’s G7 finance minister meeting. This tweet-thread, from Bloomberg’s Mike McKee, explains just how badly relations between America and the rest have deteriorated: William Jackson Food Group chairman Nicholas Oughtred says Aunt Bessie’s could have a great long-term future under its new owners: “Aunt Bessie’s has come a long way with us. We’ve invested heavily in developing the business and the brand, and Nomad Foods is well placed to take the business even further. Nomad Foods is a well-known food group with a strong commitment to the frozen category, incredible experience, scale and investment capabilities and I’m sure Aunt Bessie’s will continue to thrive. “We are exceptionally proud of everyone who works at Aunt Bessie’s and are grateful to them for helping it become the much-loved household name that it is today.” Newsflash: Where there’s puds, there’s brass! Aunt Bessie’s, maker of frozen Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes has just been sold to Nomad Foods, for the princely sum of €240m (£210m). Nomad already owns Birds Eye, Findus, Iglo and Goodfella’s, so this deal helps to tighten its grip on Britain’s frozen foods aisles. In a statement just released, Nomad say that acquiring Aunt Bessie’s will expand their portfolio into the “major eating occasion” of roast dinners. Stefan Descheemaeker, Nomad Foods’ Chief Executive Officer explains: Aunt Bessie’s significantly expands our presence within potatoes, one of the largest categories in frozen food, while adding another dimension to our growing portfolio in the United Kingdom.” Aunt Bessie’s is being sold by William Jackson &amp; Son Limited (which also owns veg box supplier Abel &amp; Cole). Back in 2015, CEO Norman Soutar explained that the company appealed to cooks who fear getting their roast puds and spuds wrong [one trick is to get the oil really hot....] Britain’s stock market continues to shrug off the trade war anxiety. The FTSE 100 is now up 61 points, or 0.8%, at 7762 - a one-week high. United Utilities, Severn Trent and easyJet are all topping the risers, after City analysts raised their price targets for their respective shares. UK cardboard box maker DS Smith is also in demand. Its shares are up 3% after announcing a £1.7bn takeover of Spanish packaging rival Europac. Back in the markets, Italian government is recovering in value this morning - pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. That shows that fears that Italy might quit the euro are fading, after its new populist government was sworn in last week. But... the coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement is surely heading for clashes with Brussels over their spending and migration plans. Last weekend, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio said he hoped to introduce a universal basic income for poorer Italians while League’s leader Matteo Salvini vowed to cut spending on asylum seekers and deport migrants. The sharp decline in eurozone investor confidence may be a sign that Europe’s economy is faltering. Here’s some snap reaction from economists: Investor optimism across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, thanks to trade war fears and the Italian political crisis. That’s according to Sentix, the German research group. Sentix’s index of eurozone investor morale has tumbled to just 9.3 this month, down from 19.2 in May. That’s much worse than expected, and extends the index’s recent losses. Investors told Sentix they are less optimistic about future prospects, and that current conditions have deteriorated. Last month’s chaos in Italy over its new government helped to drag down economic prospects in the eurozone, says Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix. He added: “The new government in Italy is causing great concern about the euro zone among investors.” Hübner added that investors are also concerned about America’s “punitive tariffs”, while still hoping that a full-blown trade war can be avoided. Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club is disappointed that Britain’s construction PMI was unchanged at 52.5 last month. He says it’s a sign that building firms are struggling to gain any momentum: Fuelling concerns about the construction sector’s difficulties in building momentum, new orders contracted anew in May, confidence was at a 7-month low and employment growth slowed. This suggests that a marked upturn in construction activity is likely to remain conspicuous by its absence The construction sector’s difficulties in recent months has clearly been influenced by economic and Brexit uncertainties fuelling clients’ caution over committing to new projects. Lacklustre economic activity in some sectors of the economy (such as retail) has also weighed down on construction, as has a shortage on new infrastructure projects. It is also evident that construction sector has suffered from some fall-out from the collapse of Carillion early in the year. Newsflash: Britain’s builders are suffering from political uncertainty, which has helped to undermine new business opportunities. The monthly survey of UK construction, from data firm Markit, shows that new order books shrank in May, for the fourth time in five months. Optimism about growth prospects also shrank, to a seven-month low, with bosses blaming fears of political and economic uncertainty. This dragged back growth in housebuilding and civil engineering last month, although commercial construction accelerated. This left Markit’s construction PMI, which measures activity, unchanged at 52.5 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit, says UK building firms are making an ‘underwhelming’ recovery from the snow-related disruption last winter. “Inflows of new business slipped back into decline, signalling the resumption of the downward trend in demand seen during the opening quarter. Companies frequently noted that Brexit uncertainty and fragile business confidence led clients to delay building decisions in May. “With new order books deteriorating and cost pressures picking back up, it’s not surprising to see construction firms taking a dimmer view of prospects and pulling-back on hiring, all of which makes for a shaky-looking outlook.” Donald Trump loves tweeting about rising stock markets, so he’ll be delighted that trade war fears haven’t sparked a wave of sell orders. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, reckons today’s mild market reaction will encourage Trump to stick to his guns.... but the rally could end in tears: The two main benchmarks President Trump appears to use to gauge the success of his policies are his grassroot supporters and the US equity market. His blue-collar followers are hugely supportive of tariffs, and with equity markets currently also choosing to dismiss the problem and in positive territory, this is reinforcing President Trump’s view that he is doing the right thing, making it less likely that he will back away from his current stance. This chicken and egg position, where markets don’t believe that tariffs are a credible threat, combined with President Trump’s position that markets are not worried about the issue could lead to an unpleasant reality for both sides eventually. However, for the moment investors are benefitting from positive sentiment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, could have a showdown with Donald Trump over trade at this week’s G7 summit, according to French officials. Reuters has the details: The work agenda for the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada this week has been complicated by the United State’s stance on trade, climate change and foreign policy, a source at the French president’s office said on Monday. “The U.S. position on certain issues could make negotiations on the final conclusion (of the summit) tricky,” the source said, citing foreign policy moves such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The source said President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump could hold talks on the sidelines of the summit. The latest trade war tensions have had ‘remarkably little’ impact on the markets, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: Carrying over last Friday’s robust relief rally, investors continued to ignore the trade tensions sprouting out of the US in favour of celebrating the improved political situation in the Eurozone. A feisty G7 meeting over the weekend, with US Treasury secretary having to fend-off his furious European and Canadian peers as they vented about last week’s tariff announcement from Trump, and news that the US and China made no progress in their latest negotiations, had remarkably little impact on Monday’s trading. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, says there are plenty of events that could spook the markets this week. The list includes this week’s G7 leaders meeting, central bank meetings in Turkey and Australia, a confidence vote for Italy’s new populist government, and further trade war developments. But, the strength of Friday’s US jobs data may set the tone for the start of the week, he adds. Europe’s biggest stock markets have all opened higher, as traders take their cue from last Friday’s strong US jobs report: European stock markets are rallying, despite the double-dose of trade war worries. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 37 points (or 0.5%) in early trading to 7740. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s largest companies, is also 0.5% higher. Two banks, France’s Societe Generale and Italy’s Unicredit, are leading the rally following reports they are considering a merger. In another worrying development, talks between America and China over trade have ended without a breakthrough. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Liu He, China’s economic czar, led the weekend negotiations in Beijing over the weekend. The talks centred on China’s promise to buy more American agricultural and energy products, to help lower the US trade deficit. Negotiators have hit a sticking point - Beijing won’t sign up to buy more US goods until the Trump administration have promised not to impose further tariffs on Chinese exports. The US, though, want China to make the first move. This has raised the danger that talks collapse, and that both sides impose tariffs on $50bn of each other’s exports. The New York Times says: “If the United States introduces trade measures, including an increase of tariffs, all the economic and trade outcomes negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,” China said in a statement distributed by the state-controlled news media. The apparent impasse left the Trump administration with the issue of what to do about China’s industrial policies. It also left unresolved an awkward issue for both sides: the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, which had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran. France’s finance and economy minister was particularly scathing about America’s new tariffs on certain imports, including steel and aluminium from Europe. Bruno Le Maire revealed that last weekend’s G7 finance ministers meeting was much chillier than usual, saying: “It has been a tense and tough G7 - I would say it’s been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. “We regret that our common work together at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a global trade war are looming over the financial markets as investors return to their desks for the new week. Over the weekend, the world’s top finance ministers lined up to criticise America’s new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, at a G7 meeting in Canada. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin faced a barrage of attacks, with fellow ministers warning that “collaboration and cooperation” between the G7 was now at risk. The official statement following the meeting is remarkably blunt, stating that: Concerns were expressed that the tariffs imposed by the United States on its friends and allies, on the grounds of national security, undermine open trade and confidence in the global economy. Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors requested that the United States Secretary of the Treasury communicate their unanimous concern and disappointment. Attendees had a “frank exchange” on the benefits of an open rules-based trading system -- which is a diplomatic way of saying there were verbal fisticuffs. The statement concluded by saying that “most” G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors regret the uncertainty created by America’s trade actions, which threatens global co-operation. The international community is faced with significant economic and security issues, which are best addressed through a united front from G7 countries. Members continue to make progress on behalf of our citizens, but recognize that this collaboration and cooperation has been put at risk by trade actions against other members. The issue is certain to dominate the upcoming meeting of G7 leaders later this week. The markets, though, are holding their nerve. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining almost 1.4% - its best day in six weeks. European markets are also expected to rally, following last Friday’s strong US employment data - which showed a pick-up in wage growth and job creation. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says this has cheered investors: Wall Street ended the previous week on a positive footing, lifted by a better than expected US jobs report; 223k jobs created in May vs. expectations of 200k, unemployment unexpectedly fell to an 18 year low of 3.8% and wages managed to creep up to 2.7%, better than the 2.6% forecast and a 4-month high. The solid jobs report overshadowed any trade war concerns which had been brewing and lifted the S&amp;P over 1%. Coming up today, we get a new healthcheck on Britain’s construction sector - which suffered a fall in output earlier this year, plus US factory orders and eurozone construction data. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for May 10am BST: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 3pm BST: US factory orders for April', 'Philip Hammond has restarted the sale of government owned shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, offloading a stake worth almost £2.6bn to City investors at a loss. The chancellor, through UK Financial Investments, which owns the RBS stake on behalf of the government, kickstarted the sale of 925 million shares, representing about 7.7% of the bank’s stock. The government, which will still own a majority stake in RBS almost a decade after the bailout during the financial crisis, said it would reduce the state’s ownership of the bank from about 70.1% to 62.4%. The disposal marks the first time RBS shares have been sold since the summer of 2015, when Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne was forced to defend the sale of a first tranche at a loss of about £1bn. Analysts said the government would need to sell the shares for slightly less than the 280.9p closing price on the London Stock Exchange on Monday in order to entice City investors to buy. The Treasury said it would announce the sale price on Tuesday morning. However, at just below the current share price, the latest sale will net less than the last disposal under Osborne, when the government offered shares to investors for 330p. Labour criticised the latest share sale, with the disposal coming well below the 500p per share paid by the government to save RBS at the height of the financial crisis, costing taxpayers more than £40bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” The view at the Treasury has increasingly become that RBS shares are a yoke that needs to be removed as quickly as possible, with potential to use the funds to help cut the government’s budget deficit. Officials are of the view the price paid for the shares is an irrelevance because they were bought to save RBS from collapse and not as an investment. City analysts also said there was little chance of the government recovering all of its money from RBS for at least several years. Sam Dumitriu of the free market Adam Smith Institute said it was a mistake for Labour to think that because RBS was once worth twice as much it would ever be worth that again. “Chasing your losses is not a sound investment strategy, it’s problem gambling,” he said. The latest disposal could help Hammond lay the ground for raising public spending at the budget later this year. The chancellor earmarked RBS share sales worth £3bn for each financial year until 2023 at the autumn budget, helping to keep the government’s budget deficit shrinking over the course of the current parliament. However, the sale is likely to raise eyebrows because it comes after RBS’s outgoing chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said now was not the right time to sell shares in the bank. Political turmoil in Italy and the threat of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump have rattled financial markets in recent weeks, making it a riskier time to sell shares. Even so, shares in RBS have rebounded in recent months, with the bank having reached a $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The taxpayer is still going to be significantly out of pocket as the government sells down its stake. Few argue the RBS bailout was necessary to maintain financial stability but the cost of that intervention is now starting to emerge.”', 'Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank’s treatment of small businesses – and the bank’s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers’ 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank’s annual shareholders’ meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson – who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS – said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. “Obviously when you look at what’s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,” Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell £15bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank’s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. “Last time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.” McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank’s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed “disgraceful” practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were “targeted and destroyed” and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office – designed by the bank’s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin – McEwan insisted: “Any financial services business must always hold two things – its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these – we fell the furthest – but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.” A decade on from the bank’s taxpayer £45bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a “landmark year” for the bank. RBS made a £750m profit last year – after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the “lack of integrity and fleecing of customers” that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank’s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as “ripping the heart out of local communities”. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year – which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying £1bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.', 'Another tranche of the state’s share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury’s long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was “awash with speculation” that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government’s share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Edinburgh, buoyed this year by its first annual profit since the crisis, having made £752m in 2017, and promising to resume paying dividends. However, some shareholders will be agitating for more control over the bank and its executive pay. Anger has been fuelled by a report into the “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by RBS after the financial crisis, while the bank recently announced plans to close 162 branches with the loss of 800 jobs. RBS declined to comment.', 'The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called on the government to use its position as majority shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland to block planned branch closures. McDonnell said the government should use its stake to force RBS, which holds its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, to act in the public interest and accused it of “dancing to the tune of the bank’s board”. Earlier in May RBS revealed plans to close 162 branches in England and Wales with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. The bank said the move was a response to more people using online banking. RBS also plans to shut 62 branches in Scotland, a move which the House of Commons Scottish affairs committee called “a devastating blow to the affected communities”. RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, is also likely to face questions about when the bank will restart dividend payouts. The last hurdle to resuming dividends was removed last month when RBS agreed to a $4.9bn (£3.7bn) settlement with US authorities over the sale of toxic mortgage bonds in the runup to the financial crisis a decade ago. The settlement will also allow the government to restart its programme to sell down its 71% stake in the bank. However, sales will be made at a substantial loss because when the government bailed out the bank it paid 502p per share. They are now changing hands at around 280p.', 'And finally.... RBS’s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB’s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: “It’s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. “These closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. “Under a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.” Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’ decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.” Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain’s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance.” Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: “UK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. “Falling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. “In the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.” In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they’ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald’s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple’s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America’s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour’s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald’s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of £10 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers’ Day - as an ideal time to fight their “exploitative” contracts. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a “fair and reasonable” way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn’t convinced by RBS’s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News’s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what’s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It’s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: “We are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we’ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay’s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: “keep it in the ground” and “no more fossil fuel finance” , and then: “Barclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland’s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: “If built, Kinder Morgan’s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It’s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being “irrevocably tarnished” and ask why he hasn’t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: “Consumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from £700m in February to £100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from £1bn to £100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer’s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: “A decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers’ agenda. “While the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently “trapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt” by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. “Businesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. “Prolonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned – it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.” Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU’s displeasure at Trump’s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: “The French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. “France will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. “The EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. “We agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.” Britain’s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here’s his take on this morning’s manufacturing PMI: “The implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers’ minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it’s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April’s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. “The further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn’t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain’s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit’s survey. It blames “concerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate”. Britain’s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “Any hopes for an improvement to last month’s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. “It was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain’s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It’s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it’s a disappointing result which can’t be blamed on bad weather. “While adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April’s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. “On this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter’s GDP numbers. I’ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury’s chastened CEO won’t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury’s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda’s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany’s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America’s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe’s new extension expires in a month’s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.” Australia’s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an “agreement-in-principle” with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the “unbreakable friendship” with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night’s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US – China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there’s real disappointment that Europe hasn’t been given a full exemption from Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. “Overcapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. “The EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month’s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: “We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached “agreements in principle’ with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain’s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump’s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.” The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump’s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist “America first” agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have ... We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU – which is the biggest US trading partner – has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros’ ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros’ ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We’ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain’s factory sector. April’s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We’ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It’s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here’s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies', 'Happy anniversary, averted Armageddon! Let’s have a look back, with some of the people who were there, at the people who can most-legally-unchallengeably be said to have caused it! A kind of Greatest Shits parade. The Bank That Almost Broke Britain (BBC Two) was a history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and its swift, spectacular rise to become one of the biggest banks in the world, under eight years of rule by its CEO Fred Goodwin, and its even swifter and more spectacular fall 10 years ago this month. The passage of time has done nothing to dilute the potency of the story of how greed, arrogance, hubris and light-touch regulation by a government in thrall to the tax revenues combined to bring an entire economy to within hours of collapse. Until the 1980s, RBS was run by the kind of sober-suited, sober-minded men who took the business of handling other people’s money entirely seriously. They seem like ancient archetypes now, existing only in folk memory and behind the counter in occasional Mr Men books. But the old guard looked weak in the face of new, thrusting upstarts dominating the new, thrusting era and was removed after RBS only just survived a takeover bid by a larger and – horrors! – English rival. In came George Mathewson, an engineer without banking experience, as director of strategic planning and development, who stuffed the place with mathematicians and economists and began a massive programme of modernisation. In 1998 he appointed Goodwin, an accountant who had, by means of his ruthless attitude to the costs of running Clydesdale bank, earned the nickname “Fred the Shred”, as deputy CEO. Footage of him through the years remains endlessly fascinating – so colourless he looks like a child’s pencil drawing: desiccated, unblinking, eternally 50 years old, poised somewhere between man, raptor and unsated vampire. Clydesdale apparently partied for three days when he left. Fat years followed for RBS, as Goodwin embarked on an acquisitions mission in the UK (most famously, nabbing NatWest from under the noses of rival Bank of Scotland) and (most detrimentally) in the US. The story of years of apparent triumph was smoothly and remorselessly intercut with the story of the mere hours it took to become disaster, a neat way for the makers to comment without needing to say a word on screen. “RBS became,” noted one interviewee with heavily leveraged understatement, “too big to be understood or managed efficiently by even the most talented man.” And when the economic good times stopped rolling and most of the US debt market turned out to be toxic, RBS suddenly found intself unable to borrow the money from other banks it had been using, alongside a £12bn rights issue, to keep its own show on the road. Alistair Darling – remember how we once lived lives that allowed us the energy to laugh at the comic mismatch between that snow-white hair and those badger-black eyebrows? Oh happy, golden days – appeared to explain, in the calm, measured tones of a competent politician that seem now to belong to an era as far behind us as those monocled, bewhiskered bank managers, what happened next. Which was that a committee got together and forced banks to sign an agreement that would allow them, but mostly RBS, access to the billions of taxpayers’ money required to buy up bank shares and shore up the tottering system. Agreement had to be unanimous before the markets opened the next day at 8am. Guess who was the last holdout? Aye, Fred the Not-Dead-Yet-Shred – who caved in just as the sun came up. Goodwin lost his job as a condition of the bailout, and eventually his knighthood, but fought to keep his £700,000-a-year pension. It was eventually docked by a third. Whether this hurt him as much as the collapse of RBS’s share price hurt the hundreds of employees who had been encouraged to invest in the April rights issue and lost the lot, is debatable. You suspect a master of the universe’s pride recovers quicker than a cashier’s emptied bank account. It was an unflinching look at a bleak subject. It could perhaps have gone slightly lighter on the history and heavier on the impact the near-collapse had and its continuing ripples; that the government is selling back its RBS shares but “is unlikely to recoup all £45bn of taxpayers’ investment” is a line surely worth unpacking a little more. Similarly, “the gain was privatised, the pain nationalised to the country” is a truth that can never be driven home firmly enough. But it would have been more a call to arms than anniversary marker, and we only need to be reminded of history to prevent being condemned to repeat it. Don’t we?', 'The billionaire owner of of three Grand National winners has launched a court case against a collection of former allies, claiming they unjustly enriched themselves during their joint litigation relating to Royal Bank of Scotland’s 2008 rights issue. Trevor Hemmings’ Manx Capital was part of a group of shareholders that secured a £200m settlement from RBS on behalf of thousands of people who say they were duped into investing into the now largely state-owned lender just ahead of its government bailout. Manx Capital now accuses nine subsidiaries of Lloyds Banking Group – including Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical – plus a clutch of sovereign wealth and pension funds of leaving the litigation group that was pursuing the claim without paying for their share of the legal costs. It adds that if the costs of the case fall on the remaining claimants that would amount to an enrichment of those parties not paying the legal bills. In documents outlining the latest claim filed with the high court, Manx Capital states: “The defendants have indicated in correspondence that they are unwilling to meet their obligations in respect of their pro rata share of the costs and expense ... That enrichment would be unjust ... Justice requires that the defendants should bear the burden of paying their pro rata share of the costs and expenses.” Lloyds Banking Group, plus other defendants named in the court documents, did not comment on the claim when contacted by the Guardian. Hemmings reportedly lost several hundred million pounds as a result of the collapse in the RBS share price in 2009 and later took over the management of the £200m claim against the bank, which settled before the case came to trial. He is said to be worth £1bn, according to the 2018 Sunday Times Rich List, after making his fortune in the leisure industry. His interests have included Blackpool Tower, Preston North End football club and Pontins, where he led a management buyout in 1987 before selling it to brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The tycoon has also owned three Grand National winners: Hedgehunter in 2005, Ballabriggs in 2011 and Many Clouds in 2015.', 'Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director. Flynn was the chief financial officer of Dutch bank ING until May 2017.', 'A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They’re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them £475m, so they’re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland is closing 259 branches, a quarter of its network, in a move that puts nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparked political outcry and warnings about the end of high street banking. The bailed-out lender said 62 Royal Bank of Scotland and 197 NatWest branches would shut as customers increasingly turned to online banking. The Unite union said 1,000 roles faced the axe, although the bank – which is 71% owned by the taxpayer – said the move would result in 680 redundancies after redeployment. Rob MacGregor, Unite’s national officer, described the cuts as “savage”. “Serious questions need to be asked about whether these closures mark the end of branch network banking ... This announcement will forever change the face of banking in this country resulting in over a thousand staff losing their jobs and hundreds of high streets without any banking facilities,” he said. He asked why the government – which last week signalled it was preparing to sell off its remaining stake in the bank at a loss – was signing off a branch closure programme on this scale. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow City minister, said he was astounded the government had agreed to the plan and said Labour would change regulations to stop branch closures where there is a clear impact on local communities. “As the taxpayer continues to own 71% of the bank, its priority should be serving the best interests of UK customers,” said Reynolds. The Treasury said it did not intervene in commercial decisions. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, sought an urgent meeting with RBS to discuss the impact of the bank closures across Scotland, describing rural branches as “a lifeline for many people”. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has repeatedly talked about the increasing use of online and mobile banking. Figures provided by the bank on Friday showed that since 2014 the number of customers using branches has fallen 40% while mobile transactions increased by 73%. One in five RBS customers only use its services digitally. McEwan is also under pressure to cut costs to bolster the bank’s profitability. When it reports its results in February, the bank is expected to admit it will have incurred 10 years of full-year losses since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has already reported £58bn of losses. It is the second branch closure programme announced by RBS this year, after 158 closures were announced in March. The consumer body Which? calculated that across the industry 1,747 branches have been shut in three years. Those figures do not include the 49 closures announced by Lloyds this week. The closures will take place in May and June and RBS said it would keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum. “We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected,” RBS said. Consumer body Which? warned about the impact of the closures at a time when there are fears that thousands of cash machines could be removed or start charging – because of proposed changes to the way the system operates. “At a time when the payment industry is putting forward proposals that could significantly reduce the number of free-to-use ATMs, this news will be even more concerning for consumers who must not be left struggling to access the cash they need,” said Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?. The high street banks argue they have to compete with digital-only rivals such Atom and Monzo, which operate without a branch network. These digital banks are aiming to capitalise not only on customers’ use of the internet but also to benefit from forthcoming regulatory changes that will make it easier for customers to shop around for financial products. As it published the outcome of its latest stess tests on the banking sector this week, the Bank of England said that “fintech” – financial technology – “may have profound consequences for incumbent banks’ business models”. Alongside its usual health check on the biggest lenders, Threadneedle Street looked at how banks would cope in the long-term with technological advances at a time when profits were already under pressure from low interest rates. Across the sector, the Bank calculated that profits could take a hit of £1.1bn by the end of 2023 and customers should be able to use fintech to manage their money more effectively so be less likely to use an overdraft, through which banks generate £2.6bn of profits a year.

Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the powerful committee, has called on the FCA to publish the report, which was completed last year, after it was leaked to the BBC last week. In a letter to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, Morgan said the so-called skilled persons’ report into the activities of the now defunct global restructuring group should be published without delay. It was a topic that had been raised by her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, who did not stand at the June election. Morgan said: “The FCA told the committee in November 2016 that a full account of the findings from the skilled persons’ report would be published. Nearly a year later, and nearly four years since the report was commissioned, we are still waiting for answers. “The report itself is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. The FCA now has no control over the timing or content of further public disclosures from it. The balance has tipped firmly in favour of full publication. I have written to Mr Bailey to urge him to secure the approval of RBS to do so, without delay.” Allegations about the treatment of small businesses in the GRG unit first surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary, Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. Last year, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to customers of the unit, which was closed in 2013. The FCA, which commissioned the skilled persons’ report – paid for by RBS – said it had already initiated a leak inquiry. It said: “We have asked the other parties who had access to the report, namely RBS and Promontory, to do the same. If the Treasury select committee or the BBC have evidence that the document was leaked by the FCA, we encourage them to share that with us.” The FCA said it would respond formally to Morgan’s letter.', 'Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse – for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell’s time have been about Sports Direct’s reputation – territory where the chairman clearly isn’t an idle bystander, or shouldn’t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper’s expose that prompted the business select committee’s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. “One of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,” he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct’s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes’ notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator’s report. At that point, some of Hellawell’s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell’s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders’ tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a £5m fee to Ashley’s future son-in-law, its new “head of elevation”, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell’s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley’s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour’s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, “but steer clear of the banks”. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of £10bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won’t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending – the deeper problem – would be made worse. Macpherson’s prediction of a “corrosive” process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it’s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a “national investment bank” to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.', 'Vince Cable has accused the chancellor of being “irresponsible” over his decision to sell off two-thirds of its remaining stake in bailed-out lender RBS at a significant loss. The budget red book assumes that £3bn a year will be raised over the next five years from the sale of RBS shares, helping to offset the extension in the Help to Buy scheme announced at September’s party conference. But the current RBS share price is 270p, well below the 502p at which the government would recover the money spent on rescuing the ailing lender. The Liberal Democrat leader said pressing ahead with a sale, without waiting for the share price to recover further, would be “a very irresponsible thing to do”. “Even when [George] Osborne was privatising it, there was an agreement about what an acceptable price would be – there was no doubt about that.” Treasury sources suggested the bank had almost completed the recovery programme undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis. Labour’s City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “After years of mismanaging RBS, the Tories are now trying to patch up their budget by selling off the shares at a loss to the taxpayer.” The Labour manifesto suggested breaking up RBS to create a series of local banks.', 'A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to “profit from their distress”, according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found “inappropriate action” by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of “viable firms” they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. GRG, which was marketed by RBS as a turnaround specialist, has been accused of pushing some companies into bankruptcy so it could pick up their assets more cheaply. The leaked report found that struggling companies had a small chance of re-emerging in a healthy state, with only one in 10 returning intact to the main RBS bank. Almost seven out of 10 firms in turnaround remained tied to complex loans organised by the GRG which were often too expensive to leave. Other companies handled by the GRG ended up in administration, liquidation or sold. GRG was more like an “undertaker” than a recovery specialist, according to one BBC source. RBS provided only limited cooperation with the FCA inquiry it was claimed, although the bank said on Friday night that it cooperated fully. The FCA provided a summary of the findings last year but the full report calls for a fundamental review of how RBS handles small business customers in financial distress. RBS is facing scores of legal actions by former customers and has put aside almost £400m to compensate some of the small business owners alleged to have suffered at the hands of GRG but some campaigners claim that compensation payments could be closer to £2bn. An FCA spokesman said many of the activities carried out by GRG were largely unregulated and its powers were therefore limited. The spokesman said the regulator “was investigating issues raised by the report which fall within our remit.” The FCA would publish a full account of the issues contained in the report once the investigation was complete, he said. An RBS spokesman said it had already acknowledged that “in some areas, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we could have done better for some customers in GRG … the bank accepts it did not always communicate as well or as clearly as it should have done and also did not always handle customer complaints well.” It said it had taken appropriate FCA-approved measures to rectify the failings including a new complaints procedure and the automatic refund of complex fees paid by customers. RBS sources said the FCA had already made clear that in a “significant majority of cases” it was unlikely that the actions of RBS “did not result in material financial distress to the customers it looked at”. The bank, which is 73% owned by the state, claims the report used a “very broad” definition of inappropriate treatment but still found GRG actions had a very limited impact on customers. Earlier this week, it reached an out-of-court settlement with businessman Stuart Wall who alleged his property company was forced into bankruptcy after involvement with the GRG. He was suing RBS for between £114m and £669m.', 'It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen.', 'Sir Vince Cable has criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland boss, Ross McEwan, for his failure to show “genuine contrition” over the bank’s mistreatment of small business customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Liberal Democrat leader also said the bailed-out bank must put aside more money – on top of the £400m already committed – to compensate firms affected by the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG), in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. In a strongly worded letter, seen by the Guardian, to the bank’s chairman Howard Davies, Cable singled out McEwan for his response to an investigation into whether GRG caused financial distress to its customers. Instead of GRG helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. “I appreciate that Mr McEwan was not personally responsible for what happened at the time since he joined several years later. However, he is now responsible for putting right the mistakes of the past,” Cable wrote. “Mr McEwan has repeatedly given, at best, qualified apologies for what happened. “RBS must now set aside a realistic sum of compensation and the £400m identified a year ago is clearly unrealistic given the number and scale of the companies affected and their potential direct and consequential losses,” Cable added. “The group must also do more to identify and hold to account the senior individuals responsible for the errors and abuses which occurred. Failing to do so will merely fuel corrosive cynicism about banks.” Cable said comments by McEwan that he was tired of small businesses “badmouthing” the bank and arguing that RBS “had done nothing wrong in the vast majority of businesses we handled” was the wrong attitude. He stopped short of calling for McEwan to quit, but said he and the bank, which is still 70% owned by the taxpayer, needed to do more to respond. “For now ... I believe the chief executive should be given the opportunity to do the right thing by showing genuine contrition on behalf of the bank he leads for its conduct in operating the GRG,” Cable wrote. “If RBS is ever to be sold at a profit to the taxpayer, as it must be, it will have first to accept liabilities and then slowly rebuild its reputation as a trusted institution.” RBS said it had not yet received the letter and would “respond in due course”. The RBS-GRG Business Action Group, which consists of more than 500 businesses that claim they were forced into financial distress by the bank’s restructuring division, welcomed Cable’s intervention. “We have long argued that RBS’s compensations process is laughably inadequate, since it ignores the issue of consequential loss that drove so many of GRG’s victims under,” a group spokesman said. “Ross McEwan needs to stop moaning, face up to RBS’s liabilities and make a proper financial provision for the misconduct of GRG and its rogue bankers. He should do so for the good of his own shareholders as well as the thousands who lost their jobs and businesses.” Cable referred the matter to the city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in 2013 when he was the business secretary. His criticism echoed that of Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, who told MPs earlier this week it was “unfortunate” that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of an independent investigation. “The report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,” Bailey told the Treasury committee. The committee published a letter from McEwan in which he said the bank “deeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past” but disputed parts of the review, which has not been published.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday agreed to pay $500m to settle charges of using deceptive practices while marketing and selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Announcing the agreement, the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said: “While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash. Home values plummeted. Vacant homes consumed neighborhoods. And for many New Yorkers, affordable housing fell out of reach. “Today’s settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.” The news comes as the bank is expected to shortly reach a separate agreement with the US Department of Justice, which is expected to run into billions of dollars. The New York agreement includes $100m in cash to the state and $400m in consumer relief for New York homeowners and communities. RBS, part owned by the UK government, has set aside $4.4bn for claims relating to its activities in the run-up to the financial crisis. As part of the New York settlement the bank admitted to selling residential mortgage-backed securities that failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. The bank moved back into profit for the first time in 10 years last month but its shares have been weighed down by concerns about the US fines. “This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us,” said its chief executive, Ross McEwan.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a £45bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan – a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 – said the bank was reporting “good results” with £1.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a £2.5bn loss. “We’ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,” said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. “We have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,” McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (£9.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS £33m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank “encouraged fraudulent trading practices” and prevented “victims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme”. The RMBS settlement – which could reach £9bn – could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached “it should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders”. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market – credit cards, motor finance and personal loans – which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was “appalling” and “that’s why we’re changing the culture”.', 'PricewaterhouseCoopers should count itself lucky. The firm’s penalty for producing an “incomplete, inaccurate and misleading” audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green’s Taveta Group, was a mere £10m, reduced to £6.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council’s 39-page account of the failings, however, and £6.5m, or 0.8% of PwC’s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: “The report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.” The details are astonishing. There’s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours’ work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison “failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate”. They should have concluded there was “material uncertainty”. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It’s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got £3.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only £355,000 in audit fees. That’s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC’s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC’s version of special measures after an “unacceptable deterioration” in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator’s verdict on KPMG’s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount £10m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC – but that’s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms – and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it’s too easy for £6.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making £822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of £652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it “fit for the future”. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of £6.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that’s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest – RBS’s brand in England and Wales – came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.', 'The Financial Conduct Authority is considering whether it can take action against Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it treated its small business customers in the five years after the 2008 banking crisis. Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too.', 'Royal Bank of Scotland has moved back into profit after nine years of losses, prompting chief executive Ross McEwan to hail “a symbolic moment”. But the bank has not included provisions for potential fines from the US Department of Justice, which are likely to knock results in the coming months. In other big UK results, there were positive reactions to Pearson but less so for British Airways owner International Airlines. Elsewhere executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to cut their share awards after controversy over their payouts, particularly the £110m initially handed out to chef executive Jeff Fairburn. On the economic front, eurozone inflation fell from 1.4% in December to 1.3% last month. Germany’s economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, as expected. Back in the UK, and the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsey said in a speech in Cambridge that productivity was key for monetary policy. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back next week. US markets have followed up Thursday’s gains with a strong opening on the last trading day of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 186 points or 0.75%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.7% better. A dip in bond yields, which eased from recent highs after Federal Reserve member James Bullard seemed to warn against too many interest rate rises this year, helped lift share prices. The impact of Brexit on UK productivity growth will continue for some time, according to the Bank of England’s Dave Ramsden. In his speech in Cambridge, he said: The dampening effect of Brexit on productivity growth – both through the effect of uncertainty on business investment in the short run and through the need to anticipate and respond to post-Brexit trading relationships – is likely to continue for some time. Here’s Reuters on the speech: Uncertainty about the extent to which Britain’s weak rate of productivity growth will improve over the coming years is a key factor for monetary policy, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Friday. Ramsden - one of two policymakers to oppose November’s rate rise - repeated some of the language used after the central bank’s February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Overall, it’s the MPC’s view that the economy’s speed limit is likely to be around 1.5 percent,” the former finance ministry official said. “That means that with very little spare capacity in the economy, even the unusually weak actual growth of around 1.75 percent over the forecast ... is still sufficient to generate excess demand,” he added in remarks...at a panel discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Earlier this month the BoE also said it might need to raise rates sooner and by slightly more than it had expected in November to keep inflation under control. Here are IG’s opening calls for US markets: Looks like a mini flash crash in the pound, soon recovered: The pound is now actually up against the dollar have been in the red for most of the day. It is ahead 0.28% at $1.3993. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden is speaking on productivity in Cambridge: The full quote is: Productivity – how much output an economy can produce using a given amount of input, such as output per hour worked – is a key determinant of the evolution of inflation, and it is one of the most important factors affecting the outlook for the UK economy and a therefore a key issue over the MPC’s policy horizon. That is particularly true now. RBS of course has been heavily criticised for the attitude to business customers shown by its GRG division . And the Federation of Small Businesses believes the bank should re-invest some of its profits in helping smaller firms. National chairman Mike Cherry said: The branch closures announced by RBS at the end of last year are set to limit access to banking for small firms all over the UK. Time that business owners spend travelling to and from bank branches that are miles away is time not spent running and growing their firms. Now that RBS is profitable again, it should look closely at how it can support the communities it’s threatening to leave behind with waves of branch closures. The bank has benefitted from public support over the years. It’s important that it now returns support to the public and small businesses. Meanwhile David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax Campaign, has hit out at the bank’s executive pay policy in the wake of the GRG debacle: RBS might claim to have turned the corner, but with jaw-dropping losses of almost £60bn this is a horror story not a success story. With the spectre of massive US fines looming and the details of the bank’s disgraceful mistreatment of customers revealed, it’s horrifying that RBS, which is still over 70% publicly owned, can somehow find £3.5m to dole out to its CEO Ross McEwan. More on Royal Bank of Scotland, and a worst case scenario in terms of the US Department of Justice fine is not expected, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index: RBS’s first headline profits this decade and a hint that dividends are “closer” have not been enough to trigger shareholder applause. The outstanding mortgage-backed securities case is too much of a worry. Lack of a clear update on the Department of Justice litigation means pay-outs are unlikely to start in 2018—dividends can’t be paid before the government has sold its 71% stake. But Friday’s share price reaction doesn’t assume the worst-case scenario. The loss of about $2.1bn in market value implies RBS is expected to pony up more than the $4.4bn it had set aside by the end of last year. But the total would still be around half the most pessimistic charge expected. It would be painful, but absorbable, given RBS’s key capital buffer had strengthened to 15.9% by the end of the year, the highest ratio amongst UK rivals. The scenario does of course require the DoJ to stick to its pattern of mandating settlements below the highest possible; usually contingent on humble co-operation (hello, Barclays). But the scenario is a plausible base case. And it would still allow RBS a tentative path to growth and shareholder returns. Markets remain in the doldrums, although they have come off their worst levels. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of a positive US open the European markets couldn’t shake their losses this morning. With RBS investors more concerned with the impending DoJ [fine] than the bank’s first profit in a decade, IAG slipping after missing full year earnings and the pound up 0.2% against the euro, the FTSE had little reason not to wallow in the red this Friday. And wallow it did, with the UK index dipping 0.3% to lurk below the 7250 mark it has struggled around all week. As for the Eurozone, despite the euro losing its way following a fall in inflation – down to 1.3% in January from December’s 1.4% – the region’s indices couldn’t pivot into the green. The DAX dropped 30 points, taking it back below 12500, a level it has failed to hold above all week, while the CAC also slipped 0.3%. There is a chance that investors might be buoyed by the US open. Currently the Dow Jones is on track to jump 160 points after the bell, a move that would effectively see the index recover all of the value lost following the release of Wednesday’s hawkish meeting minutes. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dow did very well on Thursday, and that only went so far in alleviating Europe’s losses. Much earlier, Germany released its latest growth figures, and here is the Reuters take: Foreign trade drove a 0.6 percent expansion in Europe’s largest economy between October and December, German data showed on Friday, and the momentum from the fourth quarter is widely expected to carry over into the start of 2018. The data, which confirmed a preliminary reading, shows the German economy ended last year on a strong footing despite unaccustomed political uncertainty in a country that prides itself on its stability. Germany is still awaiting a new government five months after an inconclusive election in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to form a new coalition but SPD members still have the chance to veto that deal in a ballot. Nonetheless, the flourishing economy helped the overall state budget surplus hit 36.6 billion euros ($45.07 billion) in 2017 -- its highest since reunification in 1990, Friday’s data showed. “The German economy continues to be in good shape,” said Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW state development bank. “Since 2014 it has been growing faster than the long-term trend and the strong upswing will continue this year and next.” He said the economy had performed well in the fourth quarter despite an unusually high number of public holidays and so-called bridge days, when Germans take an extra day off between public holidays and the weekend. The Federal Statistics Office said exports, which have traditionally propelled the German economy, climbed by 2.7 percent on the quarter and imports rose by 2.0 percent so net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth. But private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support in recent years, was stagnant -- as was gross capital investment. Neither made any contribution to growth. The full report is here. Back with the eurozone inflation figures, and Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the recent trajectory of inflation in the Eurozone and the stubbornly low levels of core inflation, the members of the ECB’s Governing Council are indeed well-advised to be patient and not withdraw monetary stimulus measures too early or too rapidly. Looking at the year ahead, Cebr identifies two main downside risks to the future trajectory of inflation and the Eurozone economy more broadly. Firstly, the strengthening euro could act as a serious headwind to Eurozone exporters as well as dragging inflation rates down. In unusually clear language the ECB minutes criticised the US and warned of competitive currency depreciations following remarks by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who claimed a weak US dollar was good for the American economy. The second risk for the ECB is a slowdown in the global economy and the Eurozone more specifically as the current economic upswing runs out of steam. While this is unlikely to happen in the first half of the year, early indicators hint at a levelling out of the growth cycle. Growth in air freight volumes has moved sideways since August 2017 hinting at a possible cooling of the current world trade boom. In January, the European Commission’s consumer confidence index slipped, albeit from record-high levels. Political risks persist as well; the Italian election on Sunday will in all likelihood unsettle the Eurozone’s third-largest economy for some time and important question on Eurozone reform will remain up in the air at least until coalition talks in Germany are successfully concluded. Here’s an interesting read for eurozone aficionados -a Financial Times interview with Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, favourite to take over from Mario Draghi as the president of the European Central Bank. The article, part of the Lunch with the FT series, is here (£). The EU inflation figures could mean more pressure on the European Central Bank, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: This morning’s inflation reading highlighted there’s still work to be done to reach the ECB’s target of 2%, after figures echoed market expectations at 1.3%. While Mario Draghi has tempered expectations of reaching the ECB’s target within the first quarter, he’ll be eager to see positive movement with the second quarter on the horizon. The ECB President will hope that ongoing sluggish price increases could point towards inflation picking up sooner rather than later, while also being encouraged by booming employment figures across the eurozone. It’s unlikely that the strategy in place will be altered just yet, but pressure may begin to mount on the ECB if next month’s reading doesn’t head in an upwards trajectory. Eurozone inflation has come in at 1.3% in January, in line with expectations and down from 1.4% in December. In the wider European Union, the rate was 1.6% compared to 1.7% in December, according to statistics agency Eurostat. It said: The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (-1.5%), Greece (0.2%) and Ireland (0.3%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Lithuania and Estonia (both 3.6%) and Romania (3.4%). Compared with December 2017, annual inflation fell in twenty-one Member States, remained stable in one and rose in six. In January 2018, the highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services (+0.56 percentage point), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (+0.39 pp), energy (+0.22 pp) and non-energy industrial goods (+0.15 pp). European markets may be drifting lower but Wall Street is forecast to open higher. After Thursday’s 164 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the futures are indicating a similar opening when trading starts this afternoon. More on RBS. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: RBS has broken its ten year duck and managed to squeeze out a profit in 2017, thanks in large part to a big fall in litigation and conduct costs. This is a stay of execution rather than a pardon however, because the bank is still facing a multi-billion dollar penalty from the US Department of Justice, which is now going to impair profitability in 2018. The UK part of RBS is going great guns, and even the investment bank has held up reasonably well, considering a lot of the bad bank has been rolled into it. The bank’s capital position has improved again, though the prospect of a dividend still hinges on the final settlement with US authorities... All in all, it’s been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis. Two very big shadows still loom over RBS. One is the impending fine from the US Department of Justice, which going to take a big slice out of the bank’s 2018 profits. The other is the large taxpayer stake, which has to be sold off at some point. That selling activity is going to put downward pressure on the bank’s share price, so until it’s materially completed, the market isn’t going to get too excited about RBS. Indeed with the price now standing at around half of the government’s breakeven point, the taxpayer’s still going to come out of this nursing a significant loss. Ian Gordon at Investec issued a hold recommendation: With a widely anticipated top-up provision for any US DOJ settlement de facto “deferred” until 2018e, RBS has delivered a full-year profit for the first time in ten years (2017 attributable profit +£752m). In the fourth quarter of 2017, underlying profit before tax of £512m was a £195m (28%) miss versus consensus, and guidance for 2018/19 restructuring charges is raised from around £1bn to £2.5bn. Nevertheless, we still dream of a return to private ownership in 2024e. Housebuilder Persimmon has been in the middle of a row over excessive executive pay - not least over a £110m bonus awarded to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. Fairburn recently said he would give some of the money to charity, although he would not spell out how much. Now following the controversy three executives including Fairburn have said they will only take half their entitlement under a 2012 long term incentive plan. This could see their payouts reduced by around £50m, the City believes. Predictions of opening gains for European shares have not exactly panned out. France’s Cac is up 0.23%, Germany’s Dax is up 0.25% but Spain’s Ibex is down 0.06%. As for the FTSE 100, it has slipped 0.14% after a mixed set of results. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way lower, still down 4% after its profits came in lower than expected. British Airways owner Intercontinental Airlines has fallen around 3% after it reported full year operating profit of €3.015bn, below forecasts of €3.046bn. But Pearson has put nearly 5% as it unveiled profits at the top end of its previous guidance, and said it was in talks to sell its US school courseware publishing business. Bookmaker William Hill is one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, down 2% despite an 11% rise in annual profits. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, also points to the US Department of Justice investigation. He said: Not quite ten in a row – after nine years and £50bn in losses since the financial crisis, RBS is back in the black – for the moment at least. A return to profit for RBS but the underlying strength of the business remains a bit of a doubt and with major legacy issues still unresolved it’s hard to get a firm read on where profits will be in the medium term... [Chief executive] Ross McEwan may wish to keep the champagne on ice. Whilst attributable profits of £752 million versus a £7bn loss last year will catch the headlines, concerns remain in the near to medium term that could keep a lid on the share price. We must urge caution around the investigation into mortgage backed securities by the Department of Justice. RBS says it has earmarked £3.2bn ($4.4bn) for this so far but it is likely to be significantly higher than that, based on similar DoJ investigations. RBS continues to stress that ‘substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters’. Meanwhile there remain concerns around UK investigations (Libor, GRG) which will continue to weigh. How strong is the underlying business? A key measure to determine profitability is the net interest margin (NIM) but this declined by 5 basis points to 2.13%. This is a fair bit below peers (c3%) and should temper optimism resulting from the first profit in ten years. We also see that NIM fell to 2.04% in the final quarter, evidence of a concerning downtrend, from 2.19% in the same quarter a year ago. RBS is back in profit partly because it has not yet taken a provision for US mortgage mis-selling, says Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital: RBS has reported full year results to 31st December 2017 which show adjusted profitability slightly below our own and consensus forecasts, but with a much stronger than consensus expected year end core tier 1 ratio (albeit slightly below our own forecasts). In addition the group reported its first statutory attributable profit in a decade, albeit this was largely thanks to the fact that a settlement with the US DoJ (Department of Justice) regarding historical US RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities) mis-selling has yet to be reached. The outlook statement notes the group has made a positive start to 2018F, but warns that the pace of investment in the business needs to be increased to support its transformation, resulting in a slower pace of operating cost reduction in 2018F and significant incremental restructuring charges versus previous guidance. Overall, we expect the shares to respond negatively to this news. Indeed they have. As the market opens, RBS is down nearly 4% at 271p, making it the top faller in the FTS 100. Here’s more from the bank on GRG: The bank has received significant media attention for its treatment of some small business customers between 2008 and 2013. To those customers who did not receive the experience they should have done while in GRG we have apologised. We accept that we got a lot wrong in how we treated customers in GRG during the crisis. However, these were complex and subjective cases with each case having unique facts about what was the right thing to do. The bank welcomes the FCA’s confirmation that the most serious allegations made against the bank have not been upheld and that the steps the bank announced in November 2016 to put things right for customers are appropriate. We have made significant progress in improving our culture since then. Today this bank is a simpler and safer organisation, with colleagues now fully focused on our customers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be a Friday but the corporate world is having a final splurge of results before the weekend. Leading the way is Royal Bank of Scotland, which says it is back in profit after ten years. The taxpayer controlled bank has made a full year operating profit before tax of £2.2bn and an attributable profit of £75m. And chief executive Ross McEwan seems pretty pleased about it: This is a symbolic moment for this bank and a clear indication of the progress we continue to make in putting the past behind us, while at the same time investing to build a bank which delivers for both customers and shareholders. It admits it still has a range of significant risks, including litigation with one major issue outstanding with the US Department of Justice. Further significant charges may be recognised in the coming quarters, it said. And of course it is still being investigated over the treatment of small businesses by its GRG division, with a scathing report into the scandal published earlier this week. Other companies reporting today include British Airways owner International Airlines Group, William Hill and educational specialist Pearson. Elsewhere European markets are expected to edge higher at the open after a bounce on Wall Street. Here are the opening calls from IG: But after last week’s recovery, the last few trading days have been a bit more uncertain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: That we haven’t seen any sort of follow through from last week’s gains should be a bit of a worry and probably speaks to a wider concern that the current down move in stocks may not be quite over. Investors appear to be wrestling on the horns of a dilemma in the wake of this weeks Fed minutes which suggested that the prospect of four Fed rate rises this year might not be outside the realms of possibility, despite FOMC member and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s warnings about being too aggressive on the hiking cycle yesterday. Will the prospect of rising interest rates and more importantly a move beyond the 3% level and the 2013 highs on the US 10 year mark a shift in sentiment, as concerns that rising wages and prices, may start to eat into company profit margins, and prompt a more critical eye on which companies can absorb higher costs and those that can’t. Yesterday’s decline in US yields from a four year high of 2.95% may help explain why US markets were able to rally yesterday, and pull the US dollar lower, but the inability of US stocks to close anywhere near the highs of the day only serves to highlight the lack of conviction buyers in the market, as well as some significant indecision, quite a contrast to the complacency of January. Elsewhere new figures from Germany show the economy grew by 2.9% year on year in the fourth quarter, as expected. We also get January’s eurozone inflation figures and a speech from the Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone consumer price index Noon GMT: Bank of England’s Sir David Ramsden speech', 'Police Scotland is looking into reports it has received about Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of small business customers. The Scottish police force did not reveal how many reports it had received or the nature of the complaints but it is reported to be related to the bank’s now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). GRG has repeatedly faced claims that it deliberately forced small businesses to the brink of collapse so it could profit from their demise by selling off their properties. RBS denies the claims. RBS, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it was aware that Police Scotland had received one complaint and would cooperate fully. “RBS has recently become aware that Police Scotland are reviewing an individual complaint made against the bank. RBS is not privy to any details but will cooperate with any request for information made by Police Scotland,” the bank said. Police Scotland confirmed having “received reports regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland and that enquiries are ongoing to assess if there is any criminality present in the allegations made within these reports”. The BBC reported that a formal investigation had not been launched by the police into the unspecified allegations. The latest complaints have surfaced amid continuing controversy about the publication of a regulatory report into the GRG division. MPs on the Treasury select committee have been calling for the so-called section 116 report – paid for by RBS but handed to the Financial Conduct Authority – to be published in full. But the FCA has said it does not plan to publish the reports in their entirety but will issue a summary of the findings. This week, however, the FCA agreed to a request from Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, to allow its legal adviser, Andrew Green QC, to compare the FCA’s summary with the actual report. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, is scheduled to appear before the committee on 31 October and Morgan said the committee’s advisers would report before he gives his evidence to the MPs. Last November, RBS said it would pay £400m in compensation to small businesses badly treated by the division to refund fees they were charged and said that fresh complaints could be made for alleged mistreatment of small firms between 2008 and 2013 in a process that will be overseen by a retired high court judge. The shadow small business minister, Bill Esterson, told the BBC: “For years, thousands of people’s businesses were destroyed and ruined and their relationships broken up, and sadly people [have] taken their own lives.”', 'The Financial Conduct Authority has agreed to publish the full confidential report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a significant U-turn by the City watchdog. The announcement came hours after the bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, and chair, Sir Howard Davies, told parliament’s Treasury select committee that they would not prevent the report’s release. The bankers accepted there had been a series of failings over how RBS had handled small business clients struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The move by the regulator less than two weeks after Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told parliament of his “disgust” that passages of the report into the scandal at the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had not been disclosed. Despite sections already being leaked, the FCA had argued it could not release the full text as it did not have the consent of the individuals interviewed, and there is also an ongoing enforcement investigation regarding individual bankers’ conduct. Now it intends to seek the individuals’ permission to publish. The watchdog said: “The FCA welcomes the statement by Royal Bank of Scotland, given at today’s Treasury committee hearing, that they will not object to the FCA publishing the s166 report into the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprise customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group. “On this basis, we are content to publish the s166 report. To do so will also require the consent of those who provided the information in the report and any individuals who are identified. We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish.” The report, which will probably still take years to be made public, includes embarrassing details for RBS, including a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” that was sent to GRG staff in 2009, and which appeared to show the bank prioritising fees ahead of assisting clients with financial problems. The memo referred to the struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by a banking crisis partly of RBS’s making – as “basket cases”. In a section of the memo headed “‘Rope” staff were told: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” McEwan and Davies conceded during Tuesday’s hearing that RBS was “aggressive” towards some struggling business customers. Davies told the committee that the “Just Hit Budget!” memo was “the stuff of which nightmares are made” and that “it’s hard to believe how someone could have written in such a way about a customer, or customers”. However, the bank argued that the worst examples of its conduct were not “widespread”, while confessing it had been “insensitive” and “aggressive” in its dealings. Davies said: “If that is what a customer thinks, then we have to take that on the chin and accept that.” The hearing also heard some testy exchanges in which voices were occasionally raised by MPs, who appeared frustrated by the bankers’ responses. Davies was repeatedly accused of chairing a bank lacking ethics. Labour MP John Mann said that RBS was failing to live up to the principles of Thomas Smith, whose Smith’s Bank became part of RBS’s NatWest and who believed in “exact integrity” in business. Mann was forced to explain to both bankers who Smith was. The GRG Business Action Group, which represents more than 500 businesses put into financial distress under the bank’s restructuring division, said: “We welcome the FCA’s agreement to publish the report in full, a move we have consistently called for. It is just a pity that GRG’s victims have had to wait for so long, thanks to the pointless intransigence of RBS and the regulator.”', 'The celebration of the old man’s life began on social media, the latterday chronicler of all births, marriages and deaths. Patrick Joseph McLaughlin had died, and his son, my friend Gerry, posted this notice: “Patrick will be received into St Machan’s Roman Catholic Chapel, Lennoxtown on Friday evening, 19 January at 6.30pm. Patrick’s funeral mass will take place at 10am the following morning. In Campsie it is tradition to walk from the chapel to the High Park cemetery.” Lennoxtown, a largely working-class village 12 miles north-west of Glasgow, lies at the foot of the Campsie hills and is often referred to simply as Campsie by local people. On first hearing the name Campsie, a degree of disorientation arises among the uninitiated, who may wonder if some kind of Brigadoon exists in the west of Scotland. It possesses a rough charm that has remained ungentrified despite the beauty of its location on the edge of a glen that was here at the beginning of Scotland. On a day such as this one, when we have gathered to celebrate Patrick before returning him to the care of his maker, there is no better place to be. A blue sky and two days of snow have given the hills a wintry majesty. They form a grand tapestry overlooking Patrick’s final resting place and you wonder if there is a better place in Scotland to be laid to rest. Being persistently Scottish, you also find yourself mentally assessing the extent of the graveyard and wondering if there will be enough space to receive your own remains when the time comes. An hour or so earlier, more than 500 of us had filled every pew in the church to hear about a life well lived. It was clear that the old man had been greatly loved by his friends and family, and the eulogy, delivered by his grandson, Garry, did him proud. “Patrick was a hardworking man throughout his life,” he told us. “And he had a prosperous career that took him from paper boy to mechanic to footballer to fireman to janitor.” Now you rebuke yourself silently. On hearing the word “prosperous”, you assume material affluence and one of the grand professions. It’s clear that a purer definition of “prosperity” is being conveyed here; one that speaks of being the best you can possibly be; of providing for your own; of enjoying the love of family and living by the faith of your fathers. At the end of a life, nothing matters more than these. Then came the procession. This is when the mourners walk through the village behind the coffin and up through the High Park to the cemetery. Shops and pubs lower their shutters in respect, and the other villagers pause and bow their heads. A big Saturday funeral in Campsie is a legendary thing, and the details of previous ones are recounted as lovingly as those of a cup final. It is a community event that is almost as old as Campsie itself and bears values that have been all but consumed in the jet-stream of 21st-century life. At Westminster a few days earlier Royal Bank of Scotland had attempted to defend the closure of a third of its branches in Scotland – 62 of them – amid accusations that it was abandoning the people of remote or outlying communities. Campsie has long since learned to do without a bank or a police station, and the services of a post office are dispensed from behind the counter of a local newsagent. Yet the true essence of these older UK communities is something that can’t be measured in the ledger of a financial institution that was originally established to serve them. In Campsie’s Commercial Inn, a tavern almost as old as the church, another good man’s life will be celebrated in 12 hours of wine and song. Towards the end of this sacred bacchanal the young priest who had conducted the requiem mass ventures in. His presence is greeted with deep affection and is appreciated by the throng. They know and he knows that right now this is where he should be. Earlier that morning, standing amid snow and sorrow, he had quoted from St Paul’s Letter to the Romans: “For we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.” In this Campsie tavern amid whisky and ale, they gather to declare that it has no hold here either.', 'This week should be a landmark for Royal Bank of Scotland. The publication of its annual results on Friday should mark the first time since the financial crisis that the taxpayer-backed bank has reported a profit for shareholders. RBS’s dire run started in 2008, when it racked up a loss of £24.1bn – the biggest in UK corporate history. The bank almost collapsed that year under the weight of more than £8bn of bad debts and £16bn of write-offs from its disastrous takeover of ABN Amro. Another eight years of attributable losses followed as more bad debts, restructuring charges and regulatory fines took their toll. But 2018 looks like being the year the losses end. The news isn’t as good as it looks. Most analysts, and the bank itself, were expecting a multibillion-dollar fine in the US before the end of 2017 but no settlement was reached. That penalty will have to be paid, and it could be big enough to send RBS back to a loss in 2018. Oddly, most City brokers haven’t updated their forecasts so the average estimate is for a fine of about £2bn and a loss of £592m, even though the year ended with no fine. RBS’s day-to-day business looks to be ticking along quite smoothly after Ross McEwan, the chief executive, spent four years taking it back to its UK commercial banking roots. But this success will be overshadowed by further questions about RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is accused of driving small business customers to the wall between 2008 and 2013. RBS has been involved in a long tussle with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MPs on the Treasury committee over publication of a report into the GRG. The FCA has released several partial versions, each more damning for RBS than the last. Leaked excerpts have shown staff in GRG were told to let businesses “hang themselves”. Now the full report has been leaked and the Treasury committee is considering publishing it next week – just in time for results day. RBS will round off a week in which the big high street banks will report annual results. And it’s not the only one with problems that date back to the financial crisis, or before. Barclays, which reports on Thursday, is under increasing pressure from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over the bank’s emergency fundraising in 2008. To avoid a government bailout, Barclays sold shares to Middle East investors to raise capital. Last year, the SFO charged Barclays’s holding firm with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatar by lending it $3bn to buy shares in the bank. On Monday, the SFO levelled the same charge at Barclays’s operating firm, which holds banking licences and regulatory approvals. Barclays’s UK high street business should be unaffected but, if banking licences were withdrawn from the rest of Barclays, its investment banking and global operations would be in deep trouble. It denies the charges. Lloyds Banking Group, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is also in a long-running dispute with former business customers, including TV personality Noel Edmonds, over their treatment by HBOS before Lloyds rescued the bank in 2008. HSBC is first up on Tuesday, when Stuart Gulliver will present his last set of annual figures as chief executive. He may be relieved after seven years in which HSBC was revealed to have laundered money for Mexican drug gangs, aided aggressive tax avoidance in Switzerland and threatened to move back to Hong Kong if the UK refused to be nicer to the banks.', 'TSB, HSBC and Barclays have all reported problems with their apps or websites on Friday, locking customers out of their accounts on what was payday for millions. They were the latest in a string of technical failures that have beset Britain’s online banking services and came days after Nicky Morgan, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, wrote to banks to demand answers and, possibly, compensation after previous IT disruptions. As with many of the other technical glitches that have caused disruption for customers, including an IT meltdown at Visa in June, the latest problems occurred on a Friday. TSB’s problems started at about 8am, with some customers using its mobile app or website unable to access their accounts. One company tweeted TSB: Another customer tweeted: “So @TSB care to tell me how I’m supposed to get my son to his appointment today when I can’t access me own money?” TSB said it was “working hard to fix these issues” and added that customers were still able to use their cards as normal. At about 3pm it said: “We’re sorry for any issues our customers experienced this morning on our mobile app and internet banking. These services are now recovering back to normal levels so please retry if you have experienced issues.” Some HSBC customers were unable to log on to their bank’s mobile banking app. The problem was identified at 7.40am and the bank said normal service was restored later in the morning. It added: “We will be conducting an investigation into the cause of this issue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Some Barclays customers used social media to report difficulties accessing their accounts on Friday morning. Just before noon the bank tweeted: “We did have a few problems but we’re back up and running now.” It said the issues lasted for about 30 minutes – but then its app apparently had another glitch. Shortly after 1pm, Barclays said on its website: “We’re sorry if you’re having trouble logging in to our mobile banking app – we’re working to fix this.” A short while later the bank said everything was working normally.']"
